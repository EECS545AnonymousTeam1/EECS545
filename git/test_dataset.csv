the community of bacteria and other microbe live in intestinal tract   collectively know as the gut microbiome   could be a good    investment in health   trillion of microbial cell inhabit the human body   outnumber human cell by    to one accord to some estimate   and grow evidence suggest that the rich array of intestinal microbiota help process nutrient in the food eat   bolster the immune system and do all sort of odd job that promote sound health   a diminished microbial ecosystem   on the other hand   be believe to have consequence that extend far beyond the intestinal tract   affect everything from allergy and inflammation   metabolic disease like diabetes and obesity   even mental health condition like depression and anxiety   much of the composition of the microbiome be establish early in life   shape by force like genetic and whether be    or     microbial diversity may be further undermine by the typical    american diet   rich in sugar   meat and process food   but a new study in mouse and people add to evidence that suggest can take step to enrich gut microbiota   change diet to one contain a variety of    food   the new research suggest   may be crucial to achieve a healthy microbiome   alter microbiome   however   may not be easy   and nobody know how long may take   that  s because the ecosystem already establish in gut determine how absorb and process nutrient   so if the microbial community in gut have be shape by a daily diet of cheeseburger and pepperoni pizza   for example   will not respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shape by vegetable and fruit that have more varied microbiota to begin with     the nutritional value of food be influence in part by the microbial community that encounter that food     say dr  jeffrey gordon   the senior author of the new paper and director of the center for genome science and systems biology at the washington university school of medicine in st  louis   nutritional component of a healthy diet have to be view from   the inside out     say     not just the outside in     one of the question the study set out to answer be how individual with different diet respond when try to improve eat habit   the scientist harvest gut bacteria from human   transplant into mouse breed under sterile condition   and then feed the mouse either    or    diet   the scientist then analyze change in the mice  s microbial community   of interest   the scientist harvest the gut bacteria from people who follow sharply different diet   one group eat a fairly typical american diet   consume about         calorie a day   high in animal protein with few fruit and vegetable   some of favorite food be process cheese   pepperoni and lunch meat   the other group consist of people who be devotee of calorie restriction   eat less than         calorie a day and have meticulously track what eat for at least two year   stick to a mostly    diet and consume far less animal protein than the other group   a third few carbohydrate and only half the fat   this    group   the researcher find   have a far rich and more diverse microbial community in the gut than those eat a typical american diet   also carry several strain of   good   bacteria   know to promote health   that be unique to    diet     choice as adult dramatically influence gut community     say nicholas w  griffin of washington university   the paper  s lead author   the study   publish in cell host   microbe   be not the first to report finding suggest dietary shift can induce persistent change in a gut microbial community   say dr  david a  relman   a professor of medicine   microbiology and immunology at stanford university   who be not involve in the current research   note that other study have find even more profound effect   after the human microbiota be transplant into the mouse   the mouse get to eat either like typical americans or like the calorie restrictor   mouse that have a microbiota condition by the typical american diet have a weak response to the    diet   microbial community do not increase and diversify as much     all respond in a predictable direction   but with not as great a magnitude     say dr  griffin   another aspect of the study suggest the company keep may also enrich gut microbiota        at least in mouse   at first the animal be keep in separate cage   then   when be house together   the microbe from the community condition by plant diet make way into the    microbiome     not clear how that translate to human   mouse eat one another  s dropping when live together   so easily share the bacterial wealth   still     possible human have other way of share bacteria   dr  griffin say     know from previous work and other study that spouse who live together will develop microbial community that be similar to each other     say   perhaps the good way to cultivate a healthy microbiome be to eat more fiber by consume more fruit   vegetable   whole grain   legume   and nut or seed   say meghan jardine   a register dietitian who be not involve in the current study but have publish article on promote a healthy microbiota     be also affiliate with the physicians committee for responsible medicine   which recommend a    diet     urge people to aim for    to    gram of fiber daily   well above level recommend by most dietary guideline     when look at population that eat real food that   high in fiber   and more    food   be go to see have a more robust microbiota   with more genetic diversity   healthy specie and few pathogenic bacteria

on climate change   in the last month   have issue a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large area of the arctic and much of the eastern seaboard announce two new national monument in utah and nevada   protect        million acre of federal land and deny six permit for oil exploration in the atlantic   partly because the seismic testing harm marine animal   and the announcement about the bee come a day after the fish and wildlife service say that    climate change be the big threat to the polar bear  s survival   and that without significant action to fight global warming   the bear will most likely vanish   federal wildlife official note that the process of list a species as endanger can take year   sometimes even decade   more than     specie have be list during the obama administration   second only to the more than     specie list under president bill clinton   during the george w  bush administration   just    specie be add to the list   noah greenwald   endanger specie director for the center for biological diversity   an environmental advocacy group   say activist be worry   that be head into another period like that   where hostility from the administration toward protect endanger specie cause to shut the list program down     the incoming trump administration   however   would need to undertake a lengthy process to declare the    bumblebee population recover if wish to reverse this week  s decision   and would be require by law to justify action on scientific ground   the role of these bee and other    insect be important   tom melius   the fish and wildlife service  s midwest regional director   say in a statement     pollinator be small but mighty part of the natural mechanism that sustain and world     say     without   forest   park   meadow and shrub land   and the abundant   vibrant life support   can not survive   and crop require laborious   costly pollination by hand     around the world   the population of bee   butterfly and other insect that promote plant growth be crash   a threat not only to biodiversity but also to the global food supply   a study last year from a group associate with the united nations warn that an increase number of specie that aid the growth of hundred of billion of dollar   worth of food each year face extinction     obviously     sad that anything have to get on the endangered list   but this really provide a great opportunity     say dennis vanengelsdorp of the university of maryland   a bee expert who applaud the government  s decision     when be talk about save the bumblebee   what be really talk about be save the community     the kind of measure that could protect the    bumblebee could help many other pollinator   as well   by restore habitat and food source and restrict the use of pesticide        especially    insecticide that have be link to the decline in bee specie   such measure be especially important with native bumblebee   dr  vanengelsdorp note   as oppose to honeybees   which be maintain in large colony and truck around the country for commercial pollination   the service be review three other specie of bee to determine whether ought to be list as endanger as well   franklin  s bumblebee   the western bumblebee and the    bumblebee   when a species be list as endanger   the fish and wildlife service be require to design a recovery plan   which be often carry out by other agency   nongovernmental organization   university and tribe   other federal agency have to check that action will not hurt an endanger specie or habitat   particularly when come to land use planning   bumblebee be particularly effective pollinator because   though seem to prefer native flower   will pollinate pretty much anything and can fly in low temperature and low light condition than many other insect   also use the technique of   buzz pollination     in which grab the    part of the flower in jaw and vibrate wing   shake the pollen loose   a process that seem to benefit plant like tomato   pepper and cranberry   accord to the fish and wildlife service   bumblebee be particularly important to agriculture   but agriculture be often unkind to   a number of factor have reduce the habitat available to bee   include the use of pesticide and other chemical   the domination of vast amount of farmland by a single crop   and the use of some genetically modify crop and herbicide that prevent the growth of weed in field and wildflower along border   climate change may also be shrink the bee   habitat   because of drought   rise temperature   more storm and mismatch in timing   plant may start to flower at time when the bee be not ready to pollinate   also present serious threat to the migration pattern of monarch butterfly and other pollinator   such as honeybee   while these specie may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bear or other mammal whose existence be threaten by a change climate   place on the endangered list be a victory for the specie and those who fight for     now have a symbol to rally around     dr  vanengelsdorp say

divestiture can be costly   but the    would not be alone in make that sacrifice     criticize mr  trump  s decision to put asset into a trust instead of under the far strict control of an independent manager   know as a blind trust     the only thing this have in common with a blind trust be the label     trust       mr  shaub say during an unusual news conference wednesday at the brookings institution   a policy research center in washington     son be still run the business   and   of course   know what own     even some republican ethic expert question how far mr  trump have go to confront the many ethical issue face   note   for example   that mr  trump have not promise to prohibit communication between federal employee and anyone at the trump organization   or current or future business partner     if do not have a real firewall   outsider will view do business with the trump organization as a way to gain access to the administration or to influence     say matthew t

by mainstream medium     in the late episode in extreme fake news   the founder newsweek magazine have concoct an entire web of russian connection around trump  s chief strategist stephen k  bannon simply because bannon know something about russian politic and literature     while acknowledge that steve bannon     have not be implicate in any of the ongoing probe   into   murky connection   with russian hacker and spy   and while further note that bannon   be not under investigation by the fbi for possible collusion with the kremlin     newsweek writer owen matthews insist that something even more nefarious be go on between bannon and the kremlin     but bannon  s tie to russia be ideological     matthews proclaim     and therefore   arguably   have have a more profound impact on white house policy with moscow     hit a new low in fake news   newsweek do not even bother cite   unnamed source   in relate imaginary version of white house intrigue   but simply put forward unsourced allegation that   bannon be boot off trump  s national security council in a white house coup   that be partly about   whether to appease a resurgent kremlin or confront     in rambling piece   title   alexander dugin and steve bannon  s ideological tie to vladimir putin  s russia     matthews make the verifiably erroneous claim that bannon   have praise not only putin but also a brand of russian mystical conservative nationalism know as eurasianism     matthews do not explain to reader how bannon  s characterization of putin as a   kleptocrat   that americans have to be   on guard of   can be consider praise   nor do newsweek inform how bannon  s mere mention that putin  s belief system be base on eurasianism should be construe as anything other than analysis   and have nothing to do with   praise     still   in magnificent house of card   matthews imago that   bannon and the    s admiration for putin have come into direct conflict with the white house  s new policy     not content with this sophomoric application of guilt by association   matthews go further still   suggest that the slogan   america first   somehow relate to the worldview of russian ideologue alexander dugin   whose philosophy   glorify the russian empire     this be like say that charles de gaulle must have be in cahoot with cambodian dictator pol pot because the two be nationalist   despite no    tie between bannon and dugin   matthews allege that   have common cause in the idea that global elite have conspire against ordinary people     and the old order must be overthrow     bannon   seem to admire dugin     matthews propose   a theory for which adduce no evidence   evidently spring from overly fertile imagination   at best   matthews see common thread run through bannon and dugin  s speech and conclude that must somehow be collude or at very least admire one another   since bannon believe that   individual sovereignty of a country be a good thing     matthews suggest   must have russian tie   because this be   precisely what putin  s kremlin be promote as back anti     european union candidate from hungary to france     by this strain logic   anyone who believe that national sovereignty be a positive value must therefore be a supporter of putin  s kremlin   after say literally nothing of substance in exhaustingly    article   matthews arrive at the ridiculous conclusion that the   ideological honeymoon   between trump and bannon be over     the only question now be whether bannon can survive the divorce     truth be tell   owen matthews and newsweek be not completely to blame for exercise in groundless     be follow the example of an equally fatuous story publish by the new york times last february   remarkably   the times dedicate an entire article to steve bannon  s familiarity with the writing of italian philosopher julius evola   who inspire fascists     and therefore must somehow share worldview   in the eye of the new york times   literacy have now become a crime     the fact that bannon even know evola be significant     the article eerily report   cite mark sedgwick   a british intellectual teaching in denmark   while admit that the entire connection amount to   a pass reference by mr  bannon to an esoteric italian philosopher     somehow the times see fit to produce a    essay in a desperate effort to tease out a dark association between the two man   nowhere but in the discredit mainstream medium could such    be seriously propose as anything remotely akin to true journalism   report on the news be be systematically replace by news

sister   sydney   do not     everyone  s like     wow   how in the world do   sister   not have       say payne        who once play forward on stanford  s soccer team   like sister     can not really fathom     though expert agree that genetic influence who get type   diabetes   payne  s story suggest that something other than gene must also be at play   and some researcher be focus in on one family of virus in particular   a new study from finland join decade of research suggest that enterovirus   which include over     individual virus type   may play a key role in trigger type   diabetes   which have no cure   in autoimmune disease such as type   diabetes   the immune system backfire   antibody   small protein that attack unwelcome guest like bacteria and virus   in rare case attack one  s own cell   in payne  s case   those happen to be the    cell of pancreas   without the ability to produce insulin   payne have to work tirelessly to monitor blood sugar level     can not even turn off for five minute     say     have this big graph in mind   when wake up   everything start off at zero     doctor be not sure whether and how virus trigger type   diabetes   but many point to a special property of enterovirus   these virus have a   tropism     or attraction   to those same    cell in the pancreas   accord to dr  heikki hy ty   who lead the new study at the university of tampere in finland   hy ty and other believe the virus establish a chronic infection in these cell   possibly lead to inflammation and    antibody   know as autoantibody   however   be far from a smoking gun     the association be clear   but the causation be not     say dr  mary pat gallagher   a pediatric endocrinologist at nyu langone medical center who be not involve in the study     may just be one piece of puzzle     the finland study be the large of kind   collect stool sample from more than     young child to look for enterovirus   which largely affect the gut   the child who test positive for multiple autoantibody be more likely to have be infect with an enterovirus than child who have a similar genetic risk for diabetes   only      of child with autoantibody go on to develop diabetes symptom by the end of        though hy ty say that figure be likely to increase over time     eventually   almost everyone develop diabetes if have multiple antibody     which can be detect month or even year before symptom appear   say   though many study   pdf   have show a similar link   several other have show no link at all   in the united states   a number of ongoing study be look for similar answer   one   know as   the environmental determinants of diabetes in the young     or teddy   be also try to identify environmental cause of type   diabetes     include the possible role of virus   diet   socioeconomic factor and toxic substance     payne and sister have also enrol in trialnet   a diabetes research network study way to prevent and delay type   diabetes       still not out of the wood yet     payne say of sister   who have not be find to have autoantibody   a viral connection   enterovirus cause between    and    million infection per year   often during summer and fall   accord to the centers for disease control and prevention   can spread through any number of way   shake hand   drink contaminate water   change a diaper   these infection rarely cause serious illness   and many people do not feel sick at all   but for some with weak immune system   such as infant   there can infrequently be serious complication   in contrast   few than          child and teenager may be diagnose with type   diabetes each year   accord to cdc datum from      and        pdf     though enterovirus can be avoid by handwash and avoid contact with sick people   hy ty be focus on vaccine as a possible way to prevent type   diabetes   so far   vaccine prototype have be develop only in mouse   say     that would be great if be possible     gallagher say     the problem be that there be so many strain of enterovirus     and no one strain have be identify as more culpable than the other   the finland study receive partial funding from sanofi pasteur and vactech ltd  both of which have a stake in enterovirus vaccine research and development   both hy ty and a coauthor of the study be minor shareholder of vactech and serve on board   the connection between virus and autoimmune disease be hardly a new one   last year   the zika virus make headline when seem to correlate with an uptick in    syndrome   a rare form of autoimmune paralysis that rise from the foot   still   the vast majority of people infect with zika   like the majority of people infect with enterovirus   do not develop autoimmune disease   accord to hy ty  s calculation   genetic may be responsible for   half or more   of type   diabetes case     though relatively few people who carry the genetic marker ultimately develop diabete     but genetic and the environmental may differ across country and ethnic group   gallagher say   so datum from finland   which have some of the high rate of type   diabetes in the world   may not be generalizable to country like the united states   say   adjust to a new lifestyle   between meal planning      measure insulin and account for exercise   gallagher say   young diabetes patient and family may have a hard time adjust to a new lifestyle     can pretty much be an olympic athlete     say     there   not much can not do   just require a lot more work     payne be now study to be a doctor at vanderbilt

irony be that seem to have pay a price for act in good faith     apparently believe that if ramp up immigration enforcement   then republicans would trust and come onboard for comprehensive reform

and attorney general nominee jeff sessions on tuesday afternoon   present a stark example of america  s schizophrenic racial landscape     the nation  s first black president deliver a rhetorical valediction of legacy against the backdrop of one of the most fraught and tense racial climate in recent american history   from one perspective   obama  s legacy serve as both a reflect pool of both the grandeur and travail of american history   especially tumultuous journey from slavery to freedom   obama  s high political achievement seem to chart the undeniable rise of racial progress   a trajectory that can be further witness in the growth of the black middle class   and the visible success of    black entrepreneur   business leader   politician   athlete   artist and celebrity     president obama should certainly be applaud for rescue the american economy from the brink of oblivion   pass health care legislation that give ten of million access to insurance for the first time   appoint two attorney general who champion criminal justice reform   and be a passionate advocate for the environment   marriage equality   equal pay for woman and lgbtq issue   yet obama prove   for

gesture that range from a stirring speech celebrate the   th anniversary of the selma march to the opening keynote to the new smithsonian museum of african american history     serve as racial healer in chief in the aftermath of the shooting massacre in charleston   south carolina   and reflect sadly that   if have a son would look like trayvon martin     beyond these symbolic moment   obama  s

be trace back to both the redeemer south   where reconstruction  s aftermath give rise to the   strange fruit   of black body swinge on tree from organized racial terror and the massive resistance   in a term coin by sen  harry byrd of virginia   of    white on citizen   council and elsewhere   who collude with local   state   and at time federal official to deny black folk good job   school

american politic represent an unseemly mashup of several historical era interwoven and unspoole right before very eye   obama   presidency partially fulfil the ambitious hope and civic dream of both the reconstruction era   a period that offer up the tantalizing possibility of racial equality and deep democracy   and the civil right movement  s heroic period   when activist bleed for democracy in the street of american city and die in a quest to expand the meaning of citizenship   president obama and sen  sessions exemplify two divergent interpretation and reality of american history   one that most citizen have yet to fully comprehend but that can be see all around if only care to look   the great live symbol of america  s racial progress leave office just as one of the most vocal

the role of russia in the breach     will persuade    donald trump to accept the evidence of what happen   but whatever response   can only hope that accept another troubling reality   the internet as know be under threat   last month   the department for homeland security and the fbi release joint analysis report with technical detail on how the hacker affect the email breach   all the attack use

that solicit login and password credential     begin write in the medium about the danger of    two year ago   in the immediate aftermath of the infamous sony pictures breach   goal be to shift attention away from the salacious    gossip in the email release by the hacker and encourage people to instead focus on how the hacker have accomplish this   also hope to draw more attention to what mean for the future of the internet   in the hope that policymaker and organization would wake up to this threat   then come news of the massive opm breach   the excellus bluecross blueshield datum

participate in study   that simulate attack net close to a      success rate   in which someone actually click on the   malicious   hyperlink in the email   within a few hour of the attack   reminder

and almost all report high confidence in ability to detect a phish   such finding be common in cybersecurity research   and particularly sober because   as witness during the election   a single victim can cause a massive compromise     however   suggest that people stop use email for anything important     as the    do     be not a solution   not when the very engine of all communication today be email   be the reason the internet become popular   instead of discourage the use of email   the trump administration should instead work on help to save the internet by encourage people to take step to limit the threat of       a good start would be encourage more be do to plug the single big weakness in email   system of authentication use login and password     email and most online

democrat on the senate judiciary committee panel be mostly restrain in questioning   with minnesota  s al franken the rare sessions colleague to confront over past record     deliberately overstate   franken suggest     as a civil right proponent   with party set to turn over the white house   and already nearly powerless in congress   democrats sit on capitol hill could soon take a backseat to progressive and ally group plan to stand up to trump with mass protest and direct action         the lesson   difficult conversation about race in policy clash and political conflict be not go anywhere during the trump era     the moment   both rep  john lewis   the civil right hero   and sen  cory booker   a democrat from new jersey   testify against sessions on the second day of confirmation hearing   as colleague come under fire for offer what liberal see as an overabundance of senatorial courtesy   lewis   booker and congressional black caucus chairman rep  cedric richmond zero in on sessions   history with a sharp edge     those who be commit to equal justice in society wonder whether sen  sessions   call for   law and order   will mean today what mean in alabama when be come up back then     lewis say during testimony     the rule of law be use to violate the human and civil right of the poor   the dispossess   people of color     booker   meanwhile   seek to channel the rev  martin luther king jr  when say     the arc of the moral universe do not just naturally curve toward justice   must bend       america need an attorney general who be resolute and determined to bend the arc     booker testify     sen  sessions   record do not speak to that desire   intention or will     booker  s decision to so publicly oppose a senate colleague     be the first to do so in a confirmation hearing     shed light on the depth of the racial fault line that figure to roil the new administration and critic      difficult conversation be obviously not new in this country and escalate during the course of the obama administration   when americans be focus at various time on ferguson   baltimore   black live matter and the very visceral fight over vote right and the confederate flag   trump and cabinet will bring a very different perspective than obama and   partisan fight over race seem destine to escalate over the come four year       the lesson   the role of the fbi   in particular director james comey   in the      campaign will remain a flashpoint in        the moment   democrats be alternately outrage and baffle when   in the course of a hearing with the senate intelligence committee   comey refuse to comment on whether the bureau be investigate link between    donald trump  s campaign and russia      the question come from sen  ron wyden   an oregon democrat   want to know whether the fbi have investigate potential contact between the trump campaign and russia     the director   however   be not in a forthcoming mood and refuse to comment   maine sen  angus king   an independent who caucus with the democrats   could not help     do not say one way or another whether even there be an investigation underway     king ask again     correct     comey say     do not   especially in a public forum   never confirm or deny a pende investigation       the irony of make that statement here   can not avoid     king say   a clear reference to comey  s loose lip during the campaign   when jolt the contest with a very late public revelation that agent would renew review of email potentially tie to hillary clinton  s private server   clinton be clear   again   day later   but many democrats believe the brouhaha cost precious vote in a race that be ultimately decide by the narrow of margin in a handful of state   like trump   grudge be likely to endure       the lesson   the leader of the democratic party be barack obama     and no one else come close   the moment   in farewell address from chicago on tuesday night   the outgoing president deliver a stark warning about the challenge face american democracy while   both in the speech and recent remark   offer a more coherent path forward than anyone else in party   obama say goodbye in much the same way enter national politic     with an appeal to a shared decency and common interest across the partisan divide   but a decade on from the beginning of brief senate stay   the    president address a country more openly at odd over race     after election     obama tell supporter in mccormick place     there be talk of a    america   such a vision   however    be never realistic   race remain a potent and often divisive force in society     frame that divide as a   threat to democracy     obama plead with americans to emerge from digital bubble and more openly engage with political opposite     if be tired of argue with stranger on the internet     say to laughs     try talk with one of in real life       but appeal to economic solidarity     which sound a lot more like bernie sanders than    successor hillary clinton     strike hardest     if every economic issue be frame as a struggle between a hardworke white middle class and an undeserving minority   then worker of all shade be go to be leave fight for scrap while the wealthy withdraw further into private enclave     say   while pointedly encourage democrats to engage   the    white guy     whether that add up to a win strategy remain to be see   but for a night at least   the depart obama tower over the democrats leave behind to take on trump

  in relationship   have always approach from a     how do    manage this      how do present          be a good listener         type of standpoint     martin say     but dawn on as be    come out of   the trip   that relationship be pretty much    spontaneous if you  re just present and connect            that shift   which martin say have deepen since take the    psilocybin in        have have endure implication for    relationship            now if i  m meet people   the default be to be just present          not just physically   but mentally present to the conversation        say     that switch have be profound            while feel undergo a shift during trip on    psilocybin   martin say the most enduring change in    personality and approach to interact with those around    have unfold in the month and year since take the drug   for      the drug be merely a catalyst        a     like to    call   by redirect perspective for a few hour   the    psilocybin unleash a chain reaction in the way see and    approach the world   say          this square with what researcher have find by look at the    brain on psilocybin          ask a healthy person who have trip on psychedelic what feel    like   and will probably tell see sound   the      of a drop box take on an aggressive   dark shape          or may say hear color   a bright green light seem    to emit a piercing      screech          in actuality   this            synaesthesia   as     know    scientifically        may be one example of the drug   freeing   the    brain from typical connection pattern          this fundamental change in how the brain send and receive    information also may be the reason the drug be so promising    as a treatment for people with mental illness like depression      anxiety   or addiction   to understand why   help to take a look    at how a healthy brain work                normally   information be exchange in the brain use various    circuit   or what one researcher describe to as      informational highway     on some highway   there    s a steady    stream of traffic   on other   however   there be rarely more than    a few car on the road   psychedelic appear to   opening up dozen    of different route and free up some space along the more    heavily use one       who lead the psychedelic research arm of the    center for neuropsychopharmacology at imperial college london      capture these change in one of the first neuroimage study    of the brain on a psychedelic trip   present finding    last year in new york at a conference on the therapeutic    potential of psychedelic   with the psilocybin     there be a    definite sense of lubrication   of freedom   of the cog be    loosen and fire in all sort of unexpected direction          say          this may be just the    that a depressed brain need          one key characteristic of depression be   in brain circuit in certain    region of the brain        particularly those involve in    concentration   mood   conscious think   and the sense of self      this may be part of the reason that electroconvulsive therapy      which involve place electrode on the temple and deliver a    small electrical current   can help some severely depressed people                     in the depressed brain   in the addicted brain   in the obsessed    brain   get lock into a pattern of thinking or processing    that     drive by the frontal   the control center   and can not            the    director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of    brain science at imperial college london   tell                nutt be one of the pioneer researcher in the field of    study how psychedelic may be use to treat mental illness      say that in depressed people   these overly traffic    circuit        think west los angeles at rush hour        can lead to    persistent negative thought   feeling of    can get    obsessive and overwhelming   so to free someone with depression    from those type of thought   traffic would need to be divert    from some of these congest rut and   even better   redirect to    empty highway          that   precisely what psychedelic            psychedelic disrupt that process so people can escape     nutt    say     at least for the duration of the trip   can escape    about the rumination about depression or alcohol or obsession      and then do not necessarily go back              medically   what you  re do   with psychedelic be   you  re    perturb the system     paul expert   who coauthore one of the    first study to map the activity in the human brain on    psilocybin   tell over tea on a recent afternoon in london    s    bustle whitechapel neighborhood          expert   a physicist at the king  s college london center for    neuroimaging sciences   do not exactly have the background would    expect of someone study magic mushroom          but be by draw from background as a physicist   expert    tell   that and team be able to come up with a    systematic diagram of what the brain look like on a psilocybin    trip   study   publish in        also help explain how    alter the brain temporarily with psilocybin can produce    change that appear to develop over time          when alter how the brain function          perturb the system     in    physicist parlance        with psychedelic     that may reinforce    some connection that already exist   or may be more    stimulate     expert say          but those change be not as temporary as one may expect from a      shroom trip   instead   appear to catalyze dozen    of other change that deepen for month and year after take    the drug            so people who take magic mushroom report for a long time after    the actual experience that feel well   they  re happier with    life     say expert     but understand exactly why this be the    case be quite tricky because the actual trip be very short and        not within that short span of time that could actually    have sort of new connection that be make   that take much more    time                  the clinical trial that walcoff and martin take part in   which    take place at nyu and johns hopkins over five year   be the    long and most comprehensive study have to date of people    with depression use psychedelic          last year   a team of brazilian researcher publish a   on psychedelic publish between         and        after look at     study   the researcher    find only six that meet analysis criterion   the rest be    either too small   too poorly control   or problematic for    another reason          nevertheless   base on the six study   the researcher conclude    that   psilocybin   and lsd may be   useful pharmacological    tool for the treatment of drug dependence   and anxiety and mood    disorder   especially in    patient              these drug may also be useful pharmacological tool to    understand psychiatric disorder and to develop new therapeutic    agent     write          because the exist research be so limited   scientist still    can not say exactly what be happen in the brain of someone who    have trip on psychedelic that appear to unleash such a cascade    of life change like the kind martin describe          what do know   though   be that thing like practice a musical    instrument or learn a skill change the brain     possible    that psychedelic do something similar over the long term   even    if the actual trip        the phase of drug use that many people focus    on        be pretty brief          in other word   a trip   may trigger a sort of snowball effect      in the way the brain process information   expert say          and something about the experience appear to be much more    powerful for some people than even year of take    antidepressant          a   in people whose chronic    depression have not respond to repeat attempt at treatment    with medication suggest that this may be the case   while the    trial     be design to determine only if the drug    be safe   all of the study participant say at a        that see a significant decrease in symptom   the    majority say at a    three month later that    continue to see a decrease in symptom            treat people who  d be suffer for    year   and they  re    get well with a single dose     say nutt   who be one of the    author of the study     so that tell this drug be do    something profound            between      and        the psychiatrist humphry osmond give    thousand of alcoholic lsd          be part of an experimental treatment regiman aim at help    recover   osmond think that the acid would mimic some of    the symptom of delirium tremen   a psychotic condition common in    chronic alcoholic who stop drink that can involve tremor      hallucination   anxiety   and disorientation   osmond think the    experience may shock the alcoholic   who have fail to respond    to any other treatment   into not drink again          be wrong          rather than terrify patient with an extreme case of    shake and hallucination   osmond find that the acid appear to    produce positive      change in personality      something about the lsd appear to help the suffering alcoholic      reorganize personality and reorganize life        michael bogenschutz   an nyu psychiatrist   say at a conference on    therapeutic psychedelic last year          a year later     say have not return to drinking          a   than any other exist treatment for    alcoholism          in an interview with the harvard psychiatrist john halpern   abram    hoffer   a biochemist and colleague of osmond    s   say     many of    didn  t have a terrible experience   in fact   have a    rather interesting experience            while some say the trip be interesting   other have call      spiritual       mystical     or even   religious            scientist still can not say for sure what go on in the brain    during a trip that appear to produce these type of experience      know that part of be about the tamping down of certain    circuit and the ramping up of other                one of the circuit that appear to quiet during a psychedelic    trip be the circuit that connect the parahippocampus and the    retrosplenial cortex   this network be think to play a key role    in sense of self   or ego          deflating the ego be far from the    disappointment    sound like   instead   appear to make people feel more    connect to the people and environment around            who conduct the first study of kind to take    image of a healthy brain on lsd     that finding support that idea          in a person not on a drug   specific part of the brain light up    with activity depend on what be do   if be focus    on read something   the visual cortex sparkle with action   if    be listen carefully to someone   auditory cortex be    particularly active   under the influence of lsd   the activity    be not as neatly segregate            the separateness of these network break down   and instead    see a more integrated or unified brain        say          that change may help explain why the drug produce an altered    state of consciousness   too   just as the invisible wall between    once segregate task be break down   the barrier between the    sense of self and the feeling of interconnection with one  s    environment appear to dissolve            the normal sense of self be break down and replace by a sense    of reconnection with   other   and the natural world        say            because two of the characteristic of mental illness like    depression and alcoholism be isolation and loneliness   this    newfound interconnection could act as a powerful antidote               s kind of like get out of a cave   can see the light      and can stay in the light     nutt say     you  ve be    liberate            human have a long history of look to   spiritual experience      to treat mental illness        and of use psychedelic to help bring    about such experience          ayahuasca   a hallucinogenic beverage brew from the macerated    and boil vine of the banisteriopsis caapi   yage      plant and the psychotria viridis   chacruna   leaf   have    be use for century as a traditional spiritual medicine in    ceremony among the indigenous people of bolivia   colombia      ecuador   and peru   name be a combination of the quechua word      aya     which can be loosely translate to   spirit     and   waska        or   woody vine            europeans encounter ayahuasca in the        when christian    missionary travel through amazonia from spain and portugal    see indigenous people use     the missionary call                 now understand that ayahuasca have a similar effect on the    brain as magic mushroom or acid   yet unlike magic mushroom      whose main psychoactive ingredient be psilocybin   ayahuasca  s    effect come from mix the drug dimethyltryptamine   or dmt      from the chacruna plant   and the mao inhibitor from the yage    plant   which allow the dmt to be absorb into the bloodstream                in the early        the writer william burroughs travel through    south america look for the yage plant   hope to use to      some    year earlier   a man    suffering in a ward for alcoholic in new york have a   on the hallucinogen belladonna            the effect be instant   electric   suddenly room blaze with    an incredibly white light       shortly after that   the man   william wilson

and say believe the drug could    help alcoholic achieve one of the central tenet of aa      acceptance of   a power great than            nevertheless   ayahuasca   lsd   and other hallucinogen be slow    to gain notoriety across europe and north america   see a    temporary surge in popularity in the us in the        with people    like timothy leary and richard alpert write about the   ego    loss   produce by magic mushroom as part of harvard    psilocybin project          but in        the government         and most experimentation   along with research    into potential medicinal property   come to a screech    halt                meanwhile   scientist have experiment with the drug in    whatever capacity can          bogenschutz have spend year study the effect of a single dose    of psychedelic on addict     find that in most case      study suggest the hallucinogen can improve mood   decrease    anxiety   increase motivation   change personality   belief   and    value   and   most importantly   decrease craving   but how            one of the big question be how would a single use produce    last behavior change     say in          because if this be    go to produce any lasting effect   there have to be consistent    change            base on several small pilot study that   help conduct      bogenschutz hypothesize that the drug affect addict in two    way   which break down into acute     effect and    secondary     effect          in the short term   psychedelic affect serotonin receptor      the brain  s main    neurotransmitter   next      affect glutamate receptor   which appear to produce the      transformative experience and psychological insight    that people experience on the drug            this be the most rewarding work i  ve ever do     bogenschutz    say     to see these kind of experience         s just not as    easy to get there with psychotherapy            from the time be bear   clark martin  s daughter and    father have a difficult relationship   martin and partner never    married   but love child and divide time with    as best could          still   martin could not help but feel as though time    together be consistently strain   for one thing   the    spontaneity that   so vital to many relationship be absent      always know when time together start and when be    come to an end            you  re not have as much everyday experience     martin say        instead   you  re have kind of a planned experience   and that    affect the depth of the relationship   think                  martin feel similarly about father   who have develop    alzheimer    s several year before   martin would visit when    could   but whenever be together   martin feel compel to    try to push the visit into the confine of what think a      normal      interaction should be   he  d try to make    discussion mirror the one would have have before father    become ill            keep try to have     normal     conversation with     martin    say          about three hour into psilocybin trip at johns hopkins      martin recall a memory of teenage daughter          say   have be so focused on pursue own idea about    what be good for   try to be the architect of life        that have let that get in the way of make sure know how    much love and care about          one afternoon about a year after the trip   martin drive out to    visit father   this time   martin take for a drive            always love farming and ranching   and we  d just get in the    car and spend hour drive along     martin say          as drive   rolling   green hill speed past   father    look out at the lush horizon with awe   as if be see    for the first time   the crisp   blue sky   the soft blanket of    grass          all of a sudden   martin  s father see something   gesture out    the window   but martin see nothing        just grass and tree and    sky   then something move in the distance          there   in the middle of two emerald hill   a deer cock head    up            be mile away     martin say     would have completely miss

and cheap flight possible          luckily   some be willing to share secret on    a   that ask     what be the good    flight booking hack            keep scroll for some tip and trick that may make all    the difference          quora user   who have          mile in the sky    under belt   say that when   book flight make sure    to check travel search engine like      and     as well as airline   website          go that extra step ensure get the good deal out    there   plus   many travel search engine allow to set price    alert for certain flight   which be a great way to keep    track of fare          however   keep in mind that when book directly through an    airline  s website and flight get cancel   will have    an easy time deal with the airline        and get rebooke          than would if have book through a travel search    engine                this may seem like an obvious one   but nonstop flight be    typically more expensive than flight with layover   so if be    look for the cheap possible option   udayakumar say to    consider book a flight with a layover          even better   look for a layover that   long enough to allow    to leave the airport         s like take two trip in one          accord to udayakumar   travel agency and airline often use    computer   cookie to determine what kind of flight be    interested in booking   once discover what be look    for   will often raise price accordingly          to prevent this from happen   can either clear browser    cache or just open an incognito tab before start the booking    process                this hack be better suit for risk taker   as    involve gambling with airline   udayakumar suggest    book a cheap flight with a super short connection time that      almost impossible to make          before even board first flight   tell a gate agent    that be worried about not make connection   and ask    if can rebook onto a   more expensive   direct flight    to destination          if work   just score a direct flight for a great    price   if do not   well   be stick with a connection    probably will not make          accord to quora user   a frequent flyer with star alliance    and a lufthansa expert member   some airline probably    have not hear often offer the cheap fare for    transatlantic flight          keane suggest check   and                flight price differ widely from country to country   say quora    user and avid traveler   often   so pretend be book from   say   india      instead of the us   can make all the difference          there be two way to go about this   let say be    fly from la to delhi   can either go to    www   airindia   in   instead of   com            this also work for travel search engine site        or mask    computer  s ip address by use an indian vpn to make seem like    be locate in india   just know that will be purchase that    flight in rupee   so make sure to use a card without foreign    transaction fee          there be also the risk of accidentally book a        fare        meaning can only be use by local          but more often than not nobody check to make sure that    be   in fact   a local          quora user   refer to this hack as      hide city ticketing     here    s the example srivastava use to    explain the trick   say you  re fly from new york to chicago and    find a cheap flight that go from new york to kentucky   but    with a layover in chicago   chance be a flight like this will be    cheap than a nonstop flight from new york to chicago     book    that flight and then just disembark in chicago   don  t    board the connect flight to kentucky            while do this be not technically illegal   many airline    do not allow   and will even fine   there be website    t        srivastava explain that the   fifth freedom refer to    the right for an airline to carry revenue traffic between two    foreign country as part of a service connect the airline  s    home country            here   what that mean in layman  s term   generally      airline fly between home country and other country   but    occasionally   because of layover   will have flight    between two foreign country   for example   a flight    operate by singapore airlines from new york to singapore with a    layover in frankfurt be a fifth freedom flight   because neither    new york nor frankfurt be the airline  s home country   that    would be singapore            why look out for these   while not necessarily cheap     than what would usually find on these route          airline be usually not allow to list these fare on    website or on travel search engine   however       have a comprehensive   of such flight                turn out wake up at the crack of dawn for an early flight be    worth   quora user   highlight a few reason why          first   if flight be cancel can easily be move to a    later flight   if book the last flight of the day and get    cancel   be stick until the next day          second   if book a flight that get to    destination early   and that flight be oversell   can   and then get rebooke    onto a later flight   while    also receive          while book a round trip ticket in and out of the    same city may seem like the easy   most logical way    to go   quora user   say that   not always the cheap   sometimes      book two one way ticket that arrive in and depart from    different city can save a lot of money          for example   let say be fly from chicago to d sseldorf      germany   maybe fly into d sseldorf   but then fly back to    chicago out of cologne   since the two airport be only about a       minute drive from each other   so make sure to always    research nearby airport          if the first search perform for a flight be for multiple    seat   the airline may hike up price   mccoy say   so    instead   start by search for a flight for just one person   and    look into booking for multiple people later

   challenge the official sector  s assumption about the resilience    of the market   if this kind of market shock be possible during    the calm period of fall        imagine what may be possible    during the unwind of qe or during a major fiscal expansion   after    the crash   regulator collaborate on an investigation into    cause and solicit feedback from market participant who    largely share the concern of the official sector about the    evolution of the market structure   subsequently   regulator begin    by focus on three area where the market need official sector    involvement   market datum   market practice standard   and central    clearing            the scarcity of market datum be the primary impediment to the    investigation of the flash crash   regulator have move swiftly    to correct this by require trade report to the official    sector use the trace system use in the corporate bond market      this be a good start   but would encourage to go further      market participant can not make informed decision about    execution quality if can not access the datum need to    measure   commissioner piwowar  s paper on trace have show the    great public

and the preponderance of    dealer justify this   today   while investor remain    sophisticated from a financial perspective   capacity to    adapt to technological change vary widely   the role of the    dealer have also be diminish   and the way in which customer    source liquidity be rapidly change   market force can solve    most of these problem but uniform   enforceable market practice    standard woul channel those force more efficiently                with respect to central clearing   there be a strong preference    for from most market participant   but there be little    agreement as to how to bring about   this be an issue of    particular concern to direct match as a    withdrawal of    a    clearing relationship cause a    experience    of the firm   the absence of central clearing in the treasury    market serve as a moat between the end investor and the    majority of liquidity provider   and hamstring the effort of    innovator to solve market structure problem   the treasury    department should work together with market participant and    encourage to work out a solution that balance the need for    certainty with the economic of all participant            in closing   hope that once take office that will make    the continuance of treasury market structure reform one of    top priority   the departure of mary jo white from the sec and    antonio weiss from the treasury leave much unfinished work   the    fiscal plan of the trump administration and the end of    extraordinary monetary policy during tenure will present    great challenge to the treasury market on top of the exist    structural issue   the more robust the secondary market for    treasury   the easy will be to navigate the challenge that    lie ahead   these issue be not partisan   capital constraint and    electronic trading will proceed regardless of the party in power    and regulatory philosophy   direct match be hard at work on    these problem   deliver a    solution that will    welcome all participant to a single venue   direct match would    like to welcome back to the fix income world   and hope    that share concern for the market structure for us

nato be   obsolete      and remark that the eu    s future didn  t matter much to the us      comment   and outgoing vice    president joe biden   during the world economic    forum in davos   switzerland   this week            defend the liberal international order require that    resist the force of european disintegration and maintain    longstanding insistence on a europe whole   free   and at peace        biden say     the eu have be an indispensable partner of the    united states            stewart patrick   a senior fellow in global governance at the    council on foreign relations   warn that the us could see   a    revolutionary break in more than    year of american foreign    policy   if these institution be to crumble                would signal the rapid erosion of the western liberal order    that have be nurture and defend by the us since the second    world war     patrick tell business insider     find the comment    extremely concern            still

   simply not in the card     dempsey tell business insider          and the eu   be an immensely complex construction and trump have no    idea how function     say          but both institution be more fragile than be even a year    ago                the most recent shock to the eu come in june when britain vote    to leave the bloc   after the shocking   brexit   vote   geopolitical    expert

gain ground   but come with the very real    possibility of lead to the bloc     complete dismantling            patrick say that for a us president to be   encouraging and    welcome the notion that the eu would continue to dissolve   be      shocking              the eu and european country have provide the oxygen with    which the rest of international life can go on     say                  nato be also under stress   trump do not seem to have a high    opinion of the alliance   and russian president vladimir putin have    be actively seek to weaken            to have the    call into question the enduring    commitment to nato be disturb     patrick say          one of trump  s main complaint about the alliance be that member    country rely too much on the us and do not contribute enough to    own defense   have   that nato do not focus enough on counterterrorism          germany    s foreign minister    steinmei   that trump    s comment lead to   astonishment and    agitation   within nato          patrick say trump have challenge   the notion of a      international system   and create uncertainty about   whether the    us be willing to champion this world order            nevertheless   trump do have some support from within nato          a top nato general   that some aspect of the alliance be indeed    obsolete            when look at the threat be face now   see that may    have focus too much   until the ukraine crisis   may have    focus too much on expeditionary operation   especially in    afghanistan   and do that   nato have a bit fail to look at the    change in the strategic background     say french air force gen     denis mercier   the senior nato commander base in the united    states            have some structure that be obsolete            complaint of obsolescence and an    on the us in    nato be not unique to trump            donald trump be not the first person to suggest that nato    ally be not pull weight or that nato have to have a    new rationale in the    war world     patrick say          but keep nato intact be in the interest of the us   argue            there be ongoing debate about the degree to which other    country be free riding on us contribution     patrick say        but the previous president and foreign policy expert           have    invest in nato and also in support of the eu because see    this as a case of enlighten    that the community    of market democracy believe in certain thing and believe in a    certain type of order and that cement that relationship be    important                  dempsey   the carnegie fellow   agree that the   america first      isolationism that trump have trumpet isn  t likely to benefit    american security interest              trump   need ally in southeast asia   need ally in    europe     say     security be no longer the luxury of just one    state anymore because of cyber security   hybrid war   name                   unclear what exactly trump intend to do about nato once    take office   despite call the alliance   obsolete     have     be   very important to            patrick say hope trump    s adviser encourage to   offer    more temperate remark              the more that the    actually offer word of    reassurance the well because by make very    and    intemperate remark   risk unleash dynamic of which        not entirely in control     patrick say          in any case   trump  s unpredictability be a hallmark of    run for president               s as if sometimes think that the incoming administration    be turn back on the liberal order create after             dempsey say     trump be a new era   there   no doubt about that

relate to donald trump and the russians   the first   a classified report by the u  s  intelligence community   contain evidence of russian interference in the      united states election   which intelligence official have publicly conclude be intend to help trump win the presidency   the second   a    unverified opposition research report compile by a private intelligence firm   contain explosive personal and financial allegation about the    in some case allegedly gather by or in the possession of russian intelligence      the biggest intelligence questions raise by the trump dossier   and what have publicly link these two report of different genre be two page   that be the length of an   annex   append to the classify government document on russian election hacking   reportedly summarize some allegation from the other document   the private firm  s dossier on trump   and be a news leak about those two page that precipitate the publication of the full opposition dossier   though member of the intelligence community have be make aware of the dossier as far back as august        james clapper   the director of national intelligence   emphasize this week that the dossier be not       an intelligence community product       american intelligence official have neither produce nor verify the content of the report   but summarize part to provide policymaker with the   full possible picture of any matter that may affect national security       further confusing matter   appear a former british intelligence official do produce     as stanford  s amy zegart note   all intelligence be information   but not all information be intelligence   so what information qualify   and how do the intelligence community process or try to verify alleged information like what   in the trump dossier   speak about these and other question with dennis blair   who be the director of national intelligence   oversee the intelligence community   in      and        a condensed and edited transcript of conversation follow   kathy gilsinan   what distinguish the trump dossier from an intelligence product   dennis blair   an intelligence product be write to answer a specific question that   of interest either to policymaker or to operational leader in the field   and generally start with a particular intelligence requirement     what will isis do next     at the high end   down to   where be the ied in aleppo     on the low end   so the intelligence community do not just wander off and write about what catch fancy     try to provide information to help well decision   on the information that go into an intelligence report     a combination of intelligence that   gather through clandestine mean   whether be signal intelligence   where copy an email or tap a phone or human intelligence   where have a spy talk to or technical intelligence   like a picture that interpret     that   the information that go out and gather   and blend that with information that   available to most any expert in the field     database that be put together by academic institution or business in some case   observation from people in the field who be not intelligence officer   but be knowledgeable observer   start with those source of intelligence   and then have to come to some sort of an assessment of answer a question     here   where the ied be       this be what think isis will do     so that      percent of what the intelligence community spend time do   but occasionally   just in the course of     business   people in the intelligence community run across document or story that be just generally    that clearly be go to be of interest to policymaker   and when find something about the action of    that certainly fall squarely in that category   so then have to make a decision     generally at a high level in the intelligence community     as to what do with   gilsinan   so have this mysterious dossier from a private intelligence company that approach the fbi in rome   sometime in august in        generally speak   how would the community     the fbi in this case     process something like that   blair   would be turn into a field report describe how arrive   and then that context for how show up   would be forward   along with the document or evidence of other kind   and that would be send in a field report to the analytical center at headquarters   something this explosive and this big would be send at fairly high level there would be extra precaution take to make sure that   not widely disseminate   would get to leadership within the fbi and then in the intelligence community pretty quickly   gilsinan   suppose be some guy in rome in august      and go to the fbi with some explosive allegation that have totally make up   would that reach high level   how do know when to take information seriously enough to waste the boss  s time with   essentially   blair   that   a tricky one   would give     an initial screening   if the guy who walk in the door be drool      not make sense   and there be a lot of misspelling and typos in the document   would probably put in a circular file right away   but if   something that have a superficial veracity to and seem like may be true   if be sit there as the legal attach  in rome   say     wow   this be really hot     the main thing be that involve a u  s  citizen   and as soon as something involve a u  s  citizen   a whole different set of procedure   go   into play   whether involve the    or something come across with   kathy gilsinan  s   name on   simply can not be use     can not be put into a normal intelligence report   because the united states do not collect or report on americans   so there be two aspect of   number one   be about a u  s  citizen number two   be about      then the republican presidential nominee     for example   sometimes the nsa will obtain signal intelligence which say something about an american   or the nsa or cia have a spy report that talk about an american citizen   what   do in those case be that the identity of the citizen be block out in the original report   and then   determine   who that american really be require a set of extraordinary permission at a very high level within the community   but can imagine   if send this up say     go to     a hotel   would be pretty   thinly   that would actually be able disguise who be about   therefore would simply keep the whole thing in a very restricted channel   and send up to boss and say     what the hell do do with this     gilsinan   but can the fbi collect information on american citizen   blair   only if have a warrant   the only way the fbi could go out and collect the information on what americans be do overseas   for example   would be if go to a judge   and   get a warrant base on reasonable suspicion that a crime be be commit   in that case   could then conduct surveillance   put a listening bug into a room   but that   all do with the fbi     the    agency     and be either investigate a crime   or if have a suspicion   have to go through the warrant process that be all familiar with   and that   true for overseas investigation as well as for domestic one   gilsinan   and the fbi try to get a warrant in this case   blair   oh   do   gilsinan   try to get a fisa warrant   and the judge reject request   blair   good   good   the fisa system work   gilsinan   so then sound like there   not much could do to investigate this   right   the report that be read say     the fbi have be try to check this out and have not be able to verify anything     what be say seem to suggest that would not legally be able to check out anyway   blair   correct   understanding be that there   no evidence that a crime be commit   there   no suspicion   so do not have any ground to take any further   a field office would not sit on something like this and make up own idea   this would be handle at headquarters   base on what say and what know about   do not see any compelling rationale to investigate   that   stuff that reporter investigate   not the fbi   gilsinan   so there be the salacious allegation   but there be also allegation in the document of people in the trump campaign accept money or colluding with russia   which would be a crime   right   in which case the fbi could have investigate that   but would have still need a warrant   blair   have not read this document   if a document come across and say a crime have be commit   then the fbi have initial ground to investigate and there be thing can do without a warrant   just to choose   an   example   if a document that receive in an unexpected fashion say that a bank robbery occur a couple of week ago   then   worth check with the bank   and can do that without a warrant   but then the minute go further into have to take any action that invade the privacy of a suspect   then have to have a warrant   gilsinan   so hypothetically   the fbi could have ask the ritz carlton moscow     who show up          right   blair   yeah   be there a reservation in this person  s name on this date   that   sort of an easy one to check without violate privacy   and put in the ballpark of reality on something like this   gilsinan   but then would have to stop there   like   suppose the answer be yes   then what happen   blair   well   suppose the answer be     be not go to tell guest record be private     then would have have to have get a warrant   convince the judge be probable enough that could proceed   gilsinan   what   reaction as an intelligence professional about how this get out   be say that   within the intelligence community   this kind of thing would be very closely hold   and yet be bounce around dc for a couple of month   what   feeling on that   how could that happen   blair   the report be provide to several news organization   right   in addition to the fbi   on the   question of   how do the information get out that   a briefing summarize the dossier  s conclusion   be provide to the      by intelligence official   guess look at two way   the way have always find most fruitful be the cui bono test   who would either get an advantage or get a kick out of leak   the people who know about   the briefing   within the intelligence community be pretty highly place   have be involve in public spat with the president       know   not good for or for the    or for future relationship   so why in the world would put this out and make life even more difficult   so what do that lead to   that lead to    people who know about but be not involve substantively and just get a kick out of see shitstorm in the paper and be able to say to buddy over a beer     know that big story   do that     that do happen   do have cipher clerk who handle   and secretary who set up meeting and so on   and have find over time that there be some who just get a kick out of read awful stuff in the press   as long as be who provide   and that could have be on the intelligence side or on the   side of      trump  s   transition team     the way do leak investigation be go through the real police detective work of   okay   let get a copy of every document   let trace every time be send   who be on the distribution list   every meeting in which be discuss     what be the attendance list   let go out and talk to all of     gilsinan   but   the document   could also have come from the private company or from the campaign be work for     not necessarily a leak from the intel community   what to make of the fact that the allegation be take seriously enough that official feel have to brief the president and the     blair   there be no more powerful force in washington than     what if this come out somehow and be find not to have do utmost     just think of the position that the intelligence leadership have be in for the last couple of week   be sure sit around and think     what if sit on this   and   come out somehow that be sit on     and   the    say     know about this and do not tell that be out there       those be the scylla and a charybdis that be catch between   and can very much understand a decision to provide to the     clearly   base on what have say   make all of the qualification of     have not investigate this this be not verify but boss   need to know this be out there     think make that call   rather than say     let bury this     because then think the chance within the intelligence community of a leak would be much great   especially in the fbi which have this sort of sense of entitlement among a lot of agent that know more than director do   be happy to tell news people how do happen all the time   gilsinan   anything else   blair   would just give one of blair  s law develop over the year   if there be a choice in explain a government action between a machiavellian   clever   ingenious plot to achieve that result and sort of blind   bumble      incompetence   choose number two all the time

love   justice   and kindness all through a female perspective   no doubt   some critic will view victoria  s portrait of the queen as na ve or simplistic   will point out the inaccuracy or scoff at the show  s occasional use of caricature   but would be miss the point   victoria aim to provide a political history that resonate with today  s young woman   and   apparently   in britain   have   victoria consistently dominate tv rating with a consolidated average of seven million viewer   accord to goodwin   add that many of the show  s viewer be female between    and      and that victoria

the public school academy   here the law say that instead of close a fail charter   an authorizer may   take corrective action to avoid revocation     the legislation give some suggestion of how this could occur     such as appoint new board member or swap out a management company     instead of close the school   this option come with own share of chaos and game   as a reporter in detroit   have write about how management company owner have be know to shuffle from one company to another in order to avoid responsibility but maintain control of a school   notably   the legislation also say that these move     change management company   get a new board     be just suggestion the authorizer can ultimately come up with own   corrective action     which leave a lot of wiggle room         in addition to create window to get around closure   the law do not apply accountability evenly     something that naeyaert have say be important to group and why do not get behind the dec   rather   the law largely leave a charter school  s fate in the hand of authorizer   while traditional    closure be leave to the state  s school    office   that office also have the option of rescind a closure if would create too much of hardship but do not enjoy the kind of flexibility afford to    authorizer     there be a lack of equivalency that be indisputable in term of organizational arrangement have

the state  s authorizer   however   have go through with the process   and the      legislation address accreditation minimally   only say be require if an authorizer want to open a new charter in detroit   while arsen note that authorizer can still do a good job hold school accountable   emphasize the necessity in michigan create statute that assure authorizer be act in taxpayer and child  s good interest     why     ask     do take    year to come up with feature of charter accountability that still have so many loophole

53346,73529,Why Conservative Politicians May Be More Attractive Than Liberal Ones,Atlantic,Clare Foran,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,conservative politician be better look than liberal politician on average in the united states   europe   and australia     and that may create an overall advantage for conservative party   accord to a study publish in the february issue of the    journal of public economics   the study go on to suggest that the more attractive a politician be   the more likely voter across the political spectrum be to assume or be conservative   while the less attractive a politician be   the more likely voter be to assume or be liberal   prior research indicate that    political candidate win more vote   just one of the many way attractive individual seem to have well in life   there be evidence to suggest that beautiful people be view by other as more likable   trustworthy and competent   and may be more likely to land job interview and earn more money than less attractive people to name just a few advantage   to determine the political consequence of voter prefer attractive candidate   researcher at the research institute of industrial economics in sweden and the ifo institute in germany set out to find which party be populate with more attractive politician   after tally up the result of survey evaluate the attractiveness of politician in the united states   europe and australia   researcher find that conservative politician in all three place rank as more attractive on average   in the united states   these result may mean that gop candidate have an advantage over democrats in election simply because tend to be better look     politician on the right be more beautiful than politician on the left in europe   the united states   and australia     the author of the study write   add that   beauty advantage   all else equal   make candidate on the right more likely to win office and implement preferred policy     the study   title the right look   conservative politician look well and voter reward   go on to argue that conservative politician be not only consider more attractive on average   but also derive more benefit from that perception than liberal politician who be similarly attractive   specifically   the study find that attractive conservative politician win more vote than attractive liberal politician in election when voter do not know much about the candidate   propose that one potential explanation for why attractive conservative candidate win more vote be because conservative and liberal voter alike assume that more attractive candidate lean conservative   as a result   attractive conservative candidate may receive an add boost by win vote from conservative voter who believe the candidate be more likely to stand up for conservative value   while some liberal voter may be less inclined to vote for attractive liberal candidate since may assume the candidate be conservative or at least lean that way in term of ideological preference   further support the idea that voter associate good look with conservatism   researcher ask respondent to guess which political party politician represent base on a photograph   find that conservative politician who be correctly guess to be conservative be on average more attractive than conservative politician that respondent do not correctly identify as conservative     the more    a candidate   the more or be think to stand to the right     one of the study author professor panu poutvaara of the university of munich and ifo institute   say in    adding     this connection hold among both liberal and conservative voter     the research suggest voter on both the left and the right use beauty as a kind of mental shortcut when decide how to vote in scenario where do not know much about the candidate     voter indeed use beauty as a cue for candidate ideology     the author write in the study   so why would conservative politician be more attractive on average in the united states   europe and australia   the study offer a possible explanation   argue that as a result of the monetary advantage and general privilege confer by good look   attractive people may be more likely to end up identify as conservative   accord to the researcher   a simple economic explanation of the appearance gap in favor of the right be that beautiful people earn more money   and the more people earn   the more be inclined to oppose redistribution and   arguably   to support   get active in   and represent party to the right   a more general psychological explanation could be that    people be more likely to perceive the world as a just place   since be treat better than other   and be happy   and a frequent reason for people to sympathize with the left be a perception of the world as unfair   the research be not an exhaustive study of conservative party   candidate and voting behavior   in study politician in the united states   for example   researcher only look at candidate run in election date from      to        and exclude barack obama and hillary clinton from analysis   give    respondent may recognize both politician and not be able to provide an unbiased assessment   the conclusion of the study be not definitive   the suggestion that attractive people be more likely to be conservative because earn more money and see the world as a more just place be only one possible attempt at explain the conclusion of the study   and the notion that attractive people gravitate towards conservatism seem to run counter to the liberal streak run through hollywood   if nothing else   the research suggest that the outcome of election can be influence by superficial quality   though also suggest that voter associate those superficial quality with particular ideological leaning     a reminder that the reason why an individual vote for a political candidate may be far from

53348,73531,What Weird Obama Dreams Say About the President’s Legacy,Atlantic,Will Di Novi,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,for the past eight year   americans have be dream of barack obama   and not just in an aspirational sense   at every step in presidential journey   people across the united states have be see in sleep     in rapturous fantasy      nightmare   and all sort of weird situation in between   this phenomenon first come to light during the      primary   when the novelist sheila heti solicit dream about the democratic candidate on a website call the metaphysical poll   as hundred of dreamer submit report   the dream about obama gradually outnumber the dream about hillary clinton and paint a glowing portrait of the illinois senator   dream obama be a loyal husband and a generous friend   a      and a    lover     at a time when no one know who be go to win the democratic primaries   be certain be go to be obama     heti remember     have see the dream     close the metaphysical poll on june             three day after obama become the presumptive democratic nominee   but the site  s spirit live on in the work of kelly bulkeley   a psychologist of religion at the graduate theological union in berkeley   california   while complete american dreamers   a book about the dream life of american voter   bulkeley become an enthusiastic supporter of heti  s project   in        launch own sleep and dream database   a digital archive where have continue to gather obama dream over the past eight year   amass the internet  s large curated collection   with each sleepy glimpse of this former   dream candidate     bulkeley have gain new evidence to support conviction   develop over    book   that there be   an      dimension of dream     this be a novel concept in the history of dream research   where psychologist date back to freud have typically view dream as    with little relevance outside the personal wish of the dreamer   bulkeley and other contemporary researcher see thing differently   argue that a person  s dream   when compare to other   on a large enough scale   can also have collective significance   reflect concern share by community   obama   nocturnal cameo throughout presidency have serve as an exciting test case for this    theory of dream   and internet dream bank have provide the datum to back up         through much of american history   the most reliable proof that people dream about the country  s political system come from those who run   john adams and benjamin rush use to parse each other  s dream for insight into political rival   abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson report recur nightmare during year in office   when the first sleep laboratory open in the        researcher could start to document the political

world war ii   harry truman cut a sly figure on the sleepy street of the midwest   lbj ruin delicious sex dream   dream about politician can be study in unprecedented number and search through with unprecedented speed   when bulkeley launch database in        archive     obama dream from heti  s site     eight year   and two term   later   obama continue to appear among the more than          dream report on the site   show up in dream diary   opinion survey   and psychological experiment   these carefully vet entry from mostly academic source be considerably more reliable than the obama dream on    site like youtube   reddit   and dreamjournal   net   which   numerous as may be   have not be record in a transparent and systematic manner   for every dreamer in bulkeley  s database who have share a steamy oval office rendezvous   there may be other americans too bashful or forgetful to accurately record own   if gather scrupulously   and supplement with information about the dreamer   obama dream have the potential to offer a   lovely   uncontrolled example of how the president be imagine     say gary alan fine   a sociologist at northwestern university   fine study the historical reputation of american public figure and share bulkeley  s belief that dream be more than just reflection of the self   when historian turn to obama dream in the year to come   will not be for   esoteric symbolism     predict   but for what   the dream tell about american politic           though outnumber by conservative in the electorate   liberal appear to dominate the dream life of the nation      volunteer typically skew     and an intriguing body of research show that liberal be more active dreamer than conservative   in one      study for the journal dreaming   for instance   bulkeley survey thousand of american adult who identify as either conservative or liberal and find that conservative subject be   in the study  s word     slightly well sleeper and relatively minimal dreamer     while liberal participant have high rate of dream recall and   more expansive   dream   the obama dream at sleep and dream database reflect these trend   vividly document liberal   evolve view of the president over the past eight year   in the early dream   obama be a figure of messianic power   resolve dispute   levitate object   and   in one eerily prophetic dream   rip off osama bin laden  s finger with tooth   around the time of the      midterm   begin to succumb to the political crisis that the dreamer be follow in the news   a     woman from washington state dream of a sinister conspiracy involve   gm and the big oil company     who be stage the bp oil spill to make obama look bad   a      report show a     dreamer react to the news that wife   do not think like obama any more     obama continue to struggle in dream from second term   be insult at social gathering and show up to a speech   crippled and in a wheelchair     but even as obama have be wear down by the rigor of the presidency   bulkeley  s liberal subject have maintain fondness for the man behind the institution   dream of drink beer with at party   dream of meet for lunch date   as one of bulkeley  s longtime subject   an east coast liberal   put in a dream report from            obama   acknowledge presence in some way        presence be strong     that intimate bond be still on display in an    dream survey that bulkeley commission with yougov in may obama dream show up among the feverish vision of hillary clinton and donald trump   and highlight the conflicted feeling that many subject have toward the presidential contender   the clinton dream often depict a committed public servant and   a good listener     but   have none of the mystical halo of wonder and awe that people feel around obama     bulkeley recall   the dream about trump   be almost like the evil twin of the obama dream     the republican candidate project strength and confidence   and appear in dream with great frequency than clinton   but dreamer on both end of the political spectrum tend to describe in negative term     unfriendly       a jerk       a raving megalomaniac     accord to bulkeley   amid a strange and unpredictable campaign   dream obama be   comparatively speak   a calm and consistent presence         every dream researcher have interview have attribute this nocturnal stay power to obama  s visibility in the medium     modern global connectivity intensifie the effect of all see the same image     say deirdre barrett   a professor of psychology at harvard medical school     these daytime experience be what dream life be build from     as the first american president elect in the    age   obama have have image consume more frequently   and share more widely   than any of predecessor   this raise a tantalizing question   be the most    president in american history   be a point   that dream research can not yet confirm with a whole lot of confidence     bulkeley say   there be not enough control datum to compare presidential dream across administration   and dream be such an intensely private experience that social dimension will always be hard to quantify   online database may eventually allow researcher to study the most esoteric dream content in large data set   and to organize that datum with incredible speed   but big dream data be still in infancy   for now   bulkeley  s work remain   an inductive process     notice the relative frequency of certain kind of dream and then try to amass enough dream report to discern meaningful pattern in content   as gather dream datum to compare with bulkeley  s report   track down a dozen obama dreamer via dream board and    platform   a farmer in ohio   a    provider in texas   and a copywriter in los angeles   to name a few   along with dreamer from australia and canada   this be hardly a comprehensive survey of the political dreamscape   but support bulkeley  s observation   date back to the metaphysical poll   that people who be willing to share obama dream be mostly     voter with positive view of the president   even as the americans speak with have grow apart from obama on issue like drone warfare or    reform   have remain a sympathetic presence in dream   have offer advice to republican spouse   have gently deflect sexual advance   have pick outfit for important job interview   then fix egg and coffee for the road   for some dreamer   these have be regular appearance   occur once or twice a year throughout presidency for other   there be a single   unforgettable encounter   in    year of study dream about politician   bulkeley have never see another figure who more clearly support hypothesis that a person  s   frequency of appearance in people  s dream be an index of charisma     obama  s successor have own   highly polarize brand of charisma   and bulkeley predict   many people over the next few year be go to have dream and nightmare about   trump       perhaps wary of the long night that await   the obama dreamer speak with grew nostalgic as revisit sleeping encounter with america  s depart president   in obama  s final day in office   be embrace the same outlook as a dreamer from bulkeley  s site who once look on in beleaguered wonder as dream obama bolt off down a shoreline fill with crocodile     find a lot of thing wrong or risky in the

53349,73532,Why Is Obama Expanding Surveillance Powers Right Before He Leaves Office?,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,on thursday   the obama administration finalize new rule that allow the national security agency to share information glean from vast international surveillance apparatus with the    other agency that make up the u  s  intelligence community   with the new change   which be long in the work   those agency can apply for access to various feed of raw   undoctored nsa intelligence   analyst will then be able to sift through the content of those feed as see fit   before implement required privacy protection   previously   the nsa apply those privacy protection   before forward select piece of information to agency that may need to see   the update procedure will multiply the number of intelligence analyst who have access to nsa surveillance   which be capture in large quantity and often be not subject to warrant requirement   the change rankle privacy advocate   who oppose a broadening of surveillance power     especially on the cusp of donald trump  s inauguration   trump and mike pompeo   the    s nominee for cia director   have make clear that think overzealous    protection should be clear away in favor of strong surveillance law   but while the change may subject more americans to warrantless surveillance   the    timing of the announcement actually may have be design to cut future privacy loss   susan hennessey   a brookings fellow and the manage editor of lawfare   say firm up the change before trump take office make hard for the incoming president to encroach even further on civil liberty   speak with hennessey   who be previously an attorney in the nsa general counsel  s office   about the last effect of the new    procedure   a transcript of conversation follow   lightly edit for clarity and concision   kaveh waddell   first off   what do these change mean for the intelligence community   have a lack of    among agency be hold back investigation   susan hennessey   the origin of these change date back   honestly   to just after     there be this identified issue of   stovepipe     intelligence be not be share frequently or fast enough   some modification have already be make throughout the year   under executive order       as previously exist   nsa analyst have to make an initial determination and apply a set of privacy rule before share raw    information with other part of the intelligence community   after this change   do not necessarily have to be an nsa analyst that make that determination     that information can be share with other part of the intelligence community   so do not change the substantive rule   do not change the scope of collection   do not change the type of protection   do not change the possible use essentially just broaden the group of people who can apply those protection to the raw intelligence   waddell   and by extension   broaden the group of people who get to see raw intelligence   before those rule be apply   hennessey   yes   this be something that have be at the forefront of privacy and    advocate   mind when have express concern with this type of collection   but   not accurate to say the rule change mean   a raw       that anybody can get signal intelligence   intelligence agency other than the nsa will have to provide justification for why need access to that datum   can only be for foreign intelligence   or other enumerated purpose   so   not that those agency will just be able to see whatever want       that will be able to request   with particular justification   access to more raw signal intelligence than have before   then   will need to apply those minimization procedure for   the    concern often surround the use of incidentally collect information   under the new rule   the fbi could not obtain access to or search raw intelligence information for ordinary criminal in an ordinary criminal investigation against a u  s  person   however   if the fbi incidentally seize evidence of a crime   be allow to use that information   so that tend to be where the tension be for people who be concerned with the potential impact that this change could have on u  s  person   waddell   the fact that more americans could potentially be subject to warrantless search   just by virtue of be catch up in the raw signal intelligence that   share     be that something that concern   hennessey   no   look   think   important to understand that these minimization procedure be take very seriously   and all other agency that be handle raw signal intelligence be essentially go to have to import these very complex oversight and compliance mechanism that currently exist at the nsa   within the nsa   those be extremely strong and protective mechanism   think people should feel reassured that the rule can not be violate     certainly not without come to the attention of oversight and compliance body   be confident that all of the agency in the u  s  intelligence community will discharge those very same obligation with the same level of diligence and rigor   adhere to both the spirit and the letter of the law   that say   there be potentially broad reform that may be undertake   do not think that necessarily need to be link to the sharing of datum   but   reasonable to at least engage in a conversation about whether or not   appropriate to have particular    reform   like for example impose an obligation for law enforcement to obtain a warrant in particular circumstance   that   a long way of say that nothing about this particular rule change expose americans to additional privacy risk   however   that do not mean that there be not still reasonable and responsible reform which may take place   waddell   find interesting that say the change could   in one way   actually be view as a   huge source of comfort     think be refer to the timing of the change   why be that   hennessey   these change have actually be in process for eight or nine year   one of the thing that think individual who have insight into intelligence activity and be concerned about the election of donald trump     specifically   some of the statement   make about adherence to the rule of law     a lot of those people  s mind go very quickly to these procedure     important to understand the distinction between executive order       and the foreign intelligence surveillance act   one very oversimplified way to think about be that fisa be a statute that govern collection that take place within the united states   but that be aim at a foreign target       collection be aim at a foreign target   and take place outside the united states   that   shorthand that gloss over some technical and legal nuance   but those be the broad bucket people should be think about   fisa be a statute   so would need congressional action to change those rule   and have a    check there   but       be not constrain by statute   constrain by executive order   in theory   a president could change an executive order     that   within constitutional power     not as easy as just a pen stroke   but   theoretically possible   executive order       require that this series of protective procedure exist and be adhere to   the procedure be kind of where the rubber meet the road on privacy   be the detail   the     what can actually see   what can share   what do have to minimize   so be really   really important in term of what the relationship between u  s  citizen and the intelligence community look like   when be in rewrite   be sort of vulnerable   there be the possibility that an incoming administration would say     hey   while be in the process of rewrite   let go ahead and adjust some of the domestic protection     and think a reasonable observer may assume that while the protection the obama administration be interested in put into place increase privacy protection     or at the very least do not reduce     that the incoming administration have indicate that be less inclined to be less protective of privacy and civil liberty   so think be a good sign that these procedure have be finalize   in part because   so hard to change procedure once be finalize   waddell   be that why just go through an    or    process to get here   hennessey   exactly   for question both of genuine complexity and just government bureaucracy   the time horizon here be long than a single term of the presidency   so do not think that   necessarily true that the intelligence community or the department of justice be rush to get these procedure pass if anything   be a little bit late   but think the bottom line be that   comfort to a large    community that these be procedure that be sign off by director of national intelligence james clapper and attorney general loretta lynch   and not by the dni and attorney general that will ultimately be confirm under the trump administration   waddell   be there anything else should be think about with these new change   hennessey   people sometimes focus on the    stuff and end up miss the thing that be not necessarily the symbolic expression of privacy     the thing that make feel good     but be the functional element of privacy and civil liberty   what rule do people apply     and how   there   go to be a need move forward to have discipline conversation about the legal protection that really matter   if there be a silver line to some of the anxiety that the incoming administration have produce   think   the potential to move the conversation into a much more productive place   but that opportunity will end up be lose if the response be the same old same   that   last shred of optimism   and

water   fate and chemistry combine amino acid into complex molecule   and in a process still do not understand   these give rise to single cell that figure out how to make copy of   tiny mistake in those copy eventually turn into    organism call algae   endless form flow from these humble ancestor   and after eon   there be   all of human culture and hope and possibility arise within a tiny slice of time   mars be not so lucky   mars dry up   mars be small   about half earth  s diameter   so cool off faster than earth do after birth in the cloud of dust leave over from the sun  s

at first glance   seem that raise the minimum wage would be a good way to combat poverty   the argument against increase the minimum wage often rely on what call   economism       the misleading application of basic lesson from economics     to    problem   create the illusion of consensus and reduce a complex topic to a simple       case   accord to economism   a pair of supply and demand curve prove that a minimum wage increase unemployment and hurt exactly the    worker be suppose to help   the argument go like this      labor be buy and sell in a market   just like any good or service   and price should be set by supply and demand   a minimum wage   however   upset this happy equilibrium because set a price floor in the market for labor   if be below the natural wage rate   then nothing change   but if the minimum   say            an hour   be above the natural wage   say       per hour   distort the market   more people want job at          than at       but company want to hire few employee   the result   more unemployment   the people who be still employ be well off   because be be pay more for the same work gain be exactly balance by employer   loss   but society as a whole be bad off   as transaction that would have benefit both buyer and supplier of labor will not occur because of the minimum wage   these be job that someone would have be willing to do for less than     per hour and for which some company would have be willing to pay more than     per hour   now those job be go   as well as the good and service that would have produce   the

proof     a reduction in wage cost of some few thousand dollar increase employment   obviously therefore a rise in wage cost of four or five time that be go to have significant unemployment effect

goldberg of the american enterprise institute and national review chime in     a minimum wage be no different from a tax on firm that use    and unskilled labor   and if there   anything that economist agree upon     that if tax something get less of     the real impact of the minimum wage   however   be much less clear than these talk point may indicate   look at historical experience   there be no obvious relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment   adjust for inflation   the federal minimum be high from      through        when the unemployment rate be below   percent     a historically low level   when economist try to tackle this question   come up with all sort of result   in        david card and alan krueger evaluate an increase in new jersey  s minimum wage by compare    restaurant on both side of the new    border   conclude     contrary to the central prediction of the textbook model      find no evidence that the rise in new jersey  s minimum wage reduce employment at    restaurant in the state     card and krueger  s finding have be vigorously contest across dozen of empirical study   today   people on both side of the debate can cite paper support position   and review of the academic research disagree on what conclusion to draw   david neumark and william wascher   economist who have long argue against the minimum wage   review more than one hundred empirical paper in        although the study have a wide range of result   conclude that the   preponderance of the evidence   indicate that a high minimum wage do increase unemployment   on the other hand   two recent      which pool together the result of multiple analysis   have find that increase the minimum wage do not have a significant impact on employment   in the past several year   a new round of sophisticated analysis compare change in employment level between neighboring county also find   strong earning effect and no employment effect of minimum wage increase       that is   the number of job stay the same and worker make more money     not surprisingly   neumark and wascher have contest this approach   the profession as a whole be divide on the topic   when the university of chicago booth school of business ask a panel of prominent economist in      whether increase the minimum wage to     would   make noticeably harder for    worker to find employment     the response be split down the middle   the idea that a high minimum wage may not increase unemployment run directly counter to the lesson of economics       accord to the textbook   if labor become more expensive   company buy less of   but there be several reason why the real world do not behave so predictably   although the standard model predict that employer will replace worker with machine if wage increase   additional    technology be not available to every company at a reasonable cost   small employer in particular have limit flexibility at scale   may not be able to maintain operation with few worker     imagine a local copy shop   no matter how fast the copy machine be   there still need to be one person to deal with customer     therefore   some company can not lay off employee if the minimum wage be increase   at the other extreme   very large employer may have enough market power that the usual     model do not apply to   can reduce the wage level by hire few worker   only those willing to work for low pay   just as a monopolist can boost price by cut production   think of an oil cartel   for example     a minimum wage force to pay more   which eliminate the incentive to minimize workforce   in the above example   a high minimum wage will raise labor cost   but many company can recoup cost increase in the form of high price because most of customer be not poor   the net effect be to transfer money from    to    family   in addition   company that pay more often benefit from high employee productivity   offset the growth in labor cost   justin wolfers and jan zilinsky identify several reason why high wage boost productivity   motivate people to work harder   attract    worker   and reduce employee turnover   lower hiring and training cost   among other thing   if few people quit job   that also reduce the number of people who be out of work at any one time because be look for something well   a high minimum wage motivate more people to enter the labor force   raise both employment and output   finally   high pay increase worker   buying power   because poor people spend a relatively large proportion of income   a high minimum wage can boost overall economic activity and stimulate economic growth   create more job   all of these factor vastly complicate the    diagram teach in economics     and help explain why a high minimum wage do not necessarily throw people out of work   the     diagram be a good conceptual starting point for think about the minimum wage   but on own   have limit predictive value in the much more complex real world   even if a high minimum wage do cause some people to lose job   that cost have to be balance against the benefit of great earning for other    worker   a study by the congressional budget office   cbo   estimate that a           minimum would reduce employment by           job but would increase income for most poor family   move           people above the poverty line   similarly   a recent paper by the economist arindrajit dube find that a    percent raise in the minimum wage should reduce the number of family live in poverty by around   percent to   percent   the economist poll in the      chicago booth study think that increase the minimum wage would be a good idea because potential impact on employment would be outweigh by the benefit to people who be still able to find job   raise the minimum wage would also reduce inequality by narrow the pay gap between    and    worker   in short   whether the minimum wage should be increase   or eliminate   be a complicated question   the economic research be difficult to parse   and argument often turn on sophisticated econometric detail   any change in the minimum wage would have different effect on different group of people   and should also be compare with other policy that could help the working poor     such as the negative income tax   a cash grant to    household   similar to today  s earned income tax credit   favor by milton friedman   or the guarantee minimum income that friedrich hayek assume would exist   instead of greedily demand high profit   industry executive can invoke economics       which provide a simple explanation of the world that serve interest   nevertheless   when the topic reach the national stage   be economism  s facile punch line that get deliver   along with    dismissal   people who want a high minimum wage just do not understand economic   although   by that standard   several nobel prize winner do not understand economics     many lead political figure largely repeat the central thesis of economism   claim that have only the good interest of the poor at heart   in the      presidential campaign   senator marco rubio oppose increase the minimum wage because company would then substitute capital for labor     be worried about the people whose wage be go to go down to zero because have make more expensive than a machine     senator ted cruz also chime in on behalf of the poor   say     the minimum wage consistently hurt the most vulnerable     senator rand paul explain     when the   minimum wage   be above the market wage cause unemployment   because reduce the number of employee whom company can afford to hire   the former governor jeb bush also invoke economics       say that wage should be leave   to the private sector     mean company like walmart   which   raise wage because of supply and demand     for congressman paul ryan   raise the minimum wage be   bad economic   and   will hurt the economy because raise the price of labor     this conviction that the minimum wage hurt the poor be an example of economism in action   economist have many different opinion on the subject   base on different theory and research study   but when come to public debate   one particular result of one particular model be present as an unassailable economic theorem     politician advocate for a high minimum wage   by contrast   tend to avoid economic model altogether   instead argue in term of fairness or help the poor     this happen partly because the competitive market model teach in introductory economic class be simple   clear   and memorable   but also happen because there be a large interest group that want to keep the minimum wage low   business that rely heavily on cheap labor   the restaurant industry have be a major force behind the advertising and public relation campaign oppose the minimum wage   include many of the    article repeat the basic lesson of supply and demand   for example   andy puzder   the ceo of a restaurant company   and    trump  s nominee to lead the labor department   explain in the wall street journal     every retailer have location that be profitable   but only marginally   increase labor cost can push these store over the line and into the loss column   when that happen   company that want to stay competitive will close     as a result     broad increase in the minimum wage destroy job and hurt the    americans that be suppose to help     a recent study by researcher at the cornell school of hotel administration   however   find that high minimum wage have not affect either the number of restaurant or the number of people that employ   contrary to the industry  s dire prediction   while have modestly increase worker   pay   because restaurant closing do not seem to increase   the implication be that pay employee more cut into excess profit     profit beyond those necessary to stay in business   or   as the financial commentator barry ritholtz put     raise the minimum wage work as a wealth transfer   from shareholder and franchisee   to minimum wage worker     but instead of greedily demand high profit   industry executive can invoke economics       which provide a simple explanation of the world that serve interest   the fact that this be the debate already demonstrate the historical influence of economism   once upon a time   the major issue affect worker   wage and income inequality be unionization   in the        about one in every three wage and salary employee be a union member   union   of course   be an early and frequent target of economism   hayek argue that union be bad both for worker   because   can not in the long run increase real wage for all wish to work above the level that would establish in a free market     and for society as a whole   because   by establish effective monopoly in the supply of the different kind of labor   the union will prevent competition from act as an effective regulator of the allocation of all resource     for friedman   union   harm the public at large and worker as a whole by distort the use of labor   while increase inequality even within the work class   the change composition of the u  s  workforce   state     law   and aggressive    tactic by employer     increasingly tolerate by the national labor relations board   begin with the reagan administration     all contribute to a long   slow fall in unionization level   by        only    percent of wage and salary employee be union member     few than   percent in the private sector      and    worker   reduce bargaining power be a major reason why wage have not keep pace with the overall growth of the economy   accord to an analysis by the sociologist bruce western and jake rosenfeld      to    of the increase in inequality between      and      result from the decline of union   with union only a distant memory for many people   federal    legislation have become the good hope for prop up wage for    worker   and again   the worldview of economism come to the aid of employer by abstract away from the reality of    work to a pristine world rule by the   law   of supply and demand   this article have be adapt from james kwak  s book   economism   bad economics and the rise of inequality

book   a really good day   be a bestselling author   mom of four   and devoted wife   but mental illness threaten all   on good day   be funny   productive   and kind   but on bad one   would catastrophize and snap at family   so profound be    at time that   plant on a couple   therapist  s couch   could not bring to say that husband   the novelist michael chabon   love   a clear diagnosis   be bipolar ii or extreme pms     effective treatment   effexor or adderall     and even the fleeting tranquility of a   good day   be all elusive   so waldman do what few    american mom     though perhaps quite a few mom live in berkeley   california     would think to do   drop acid   procure a small      bottle of dilute lsd from a friend of a friend   be mean for   microdosing       take a fraction of a typical dose every few day   not enough to hallucinate or get high   instead   the mind open up just a crack and allow the bleak thought to escape for a while       not so much an acid trip as an acid errand     assure     waldman begin take two drop every three day   as the title suggest   over the month supply last   enjoy several unfrazzled        really good   day   as a relatively    former attorney   waldman offer a different perspective from the young tech entrepreneur who have cop to microdose to enhance creativity and output   newbie status distinguish book   as do the unique way weave in digression about drug policy and the    system   speak with waldman recently about experience an edited transcript of conversation follow   olga khazan   what would say be the big advantage for of the microdosing   from mood to work   ayelet waldman   think for personally the most important thing be that kind of    out of a pretty significant depression   let say an incident happen   someone say something that hurt feeling   see a tweet   whatever be   some kind of stimulus   there   sort of this    process   see this   there   the incident   have an emotional reaction   a feeling   then have a thought about that feeling   then have a kind of impulse   and act on the impulse   right   what have always happen to be those four separate response be all sort of clump together   so would see something on twitter   and would respond right away   there be no time at which think   oh be have a feeling about this   this be make angry   be really make angry or be make sad   be make scared   and then   here   the impulse to act   be that the right   way   to really be act   would do these thing that would regret   which would   for   end up catalyzing kind of a depression   for some reason the lsd microdose sort of slow down   be sort of try to figure out     different way to say this other than   mindfulness     because find the whole concept sort of aggravate   but do think come down to that   feel happy or at least not as profoundly depressed almost immediately the very first day take   god   here be twist into a knot to not say   mindfulness     but that really be what be   khazan   try a lot of different pill in the past   antidepressant and other drug   those be all new thing and have lot of scientist work on   test   and try to market   why do think this old psychedelic work better than all those different drug   waldman   first of all   this be a    experiment   and there   no guarantee that would have continue to work   and there   also no research that what be experience be not   as say in the book     the mother of all placebo effect     but let say that be   let say that what experience take the microdose be an actual   real effect and not all in head   take ssri   take wellbutrin   take some of the adhd drug   but only very briefly   but do not work to enhance neuroplasticity in the same way that lsd do   theory be that have something to do with the neuroplastic effect   and the range of side effect of all these new med be really robust   lsd just do not have that many side effect   mean except the most obvious one   which be if take too much start trip ball off   khazan   one thing love about this be explore other issue in drug policy throughout the book   be wonder if could give a    layman     summary of why people can not just microdose with lsd   why be illegal to acquire even in really small amount   waldman   very simply   lsd be on schedule i  schedule be a drug that  s consider to have no medical use and significant harm   heroin be on schedule   lsd be on schedule i   marijuana be on schedule i  say to that do not make any sense   no medical use and significant harm   how be marijuana in the same place on the schedule as heroin   but therein lie the incoherence of american drug law   when lsd be invent in the        be invent as a medicine   but in the      basically become a party drug   in the        the drug be criminalize   and the reason be criminalize have everything to do with what be go on politically and socially in the country   so when timothy leary stand up in front of the massive crowd at the human be in at san francisco and say   turn on   tune in   and drop out   to a group of basically all young people     and all white young people     that   very important   start take lsd   and more importantly start protest the war   and parent     nice      white parent     freak out   and become a scapegoat for this moment of social upheaval and   thus criminalize     interesting because the criminalization of lsd be not like the criminalization of marijuana   the criminalization of cocaine   the criminalization of opium   those drug be specifically tie to different minority group   marijuana   criminalization   be a way to attack mexican americans   and cocaine be really a way to attack     lsd come from a different place   the idea that kid would take a drug and start to trip just scare the shit out of everybody   so become criminalize   and as soon as something be place on schedule   all research grind to a halt   khazan   how be the health risk of microdose different from regular dosing   waldman   when go into this   assume be go to find all of these terrible thing about the health risk of lsd   but if take a microdose   maybe could ameliorate those risk   turn out actually that there have never be a record incident of a fatal overdose of lsd   if try to think about what the health risk may be     not so much physical     not like mdma   which cause a range of physical side effect   the danger   such as be   be most closely related to something that be once call lsd psychosis   if have a hallucinatory experience in an uncomfortable setting   can be terrifying   the anxiety and the fear of that unpleasant experience can have emotional repercussion   particularly if be someone with a mental illness   so that   what be worried about   could trigger some kind of anxiety in that would be bad than the profound despair find in now   but the anxiety response be to the hallucination and to the feeling engender by the hallucination   and microdosing be not hallucinatory at all   and even though would read that a million time   do not believe until take   mean be take lsd   be not the wall go to breathe   the only thing that notice be be easy for to see the beauty in natural world   live in northern california     ridiculously beautiful   walk out door and there   jasmine everywhere   the smell be overwhelming   and          percent of the time   do not even notice   when be microdose would stop and say     wow   that be a beautiful redwood tree     and again   here be   back in that horrible mindfulness place where have to use that word   khazan   sometimes   the only one that fit   have listen to the reply all podcast episode where microdose and have kind of a bad time   waldman   yeah   have   khazan   what do think of that   how do think experience be different   waldman   first of all   here   a little tip   do not take double the microdose and like do something like drive on a car on a really tiresome road trip   that seem like a mistake   first of all   do not know that what take be lsd   because do not test   also take too much   be try to keep a secret from colleague   and that maybe enhance own anxiety     the microdose   be a little activating   if have ever take adderall or ritalin   think for be not dissimilar to that   but much less intense   so think if be someone who do not normally experience those feeling of activation   then that may be disconcerting and unpleasant   but   know   no drug be for everyone   khazan   give history as a public defender work on drug case   while be do this do ever get paranoid and think   be go to get arrest     waldman   decide that do not want to stop but when bottle run out   because be feel so much well and can not understate how depressed be   be the close have ever come to be suicidal   would google the effect of suicide on young child and old child   because have both   but do think would have destroy marriage as a kind of suicide because   so important to   and because love husband so much   and marriage be such a source of comfort and strength   think destroy the thing that make feel the most safe in the world be how would have effectively commit suicide   but wake up and take the dose   and    minute later   the fog lift   have not feel like that for month and month and month   so at the end of    day   be like fuck that   be not go back to that pit   be go to go buy drug   so find a person   a number   and texte the number   and the individual who call   lucy   texte back   and be all set to go buy drug   think want five dose or ten dose   which think would carry for a year   khazan   and be like     can buy    dose     waldman     yeah   can not separate   could take        and that pump up the figure be just what happen to every one of client   when be a defense lawyer     that like     wanna buy a little methamphetamine          oh here take a lot     that   what do when wanna get someone into a mandatory minimum   jail sentence     so be in very lovely neighborhood in berkeley   outside a lululemon   when decide that the mighty force of the dea have be marshal to bring down this middle class      mom of four   run home and sit in bed and readie for incarceration   be like     alright   will be able to read   there   lot to read   be a lawyer   can help people   there be a lot of people in jail who need legal help   can not practice law   but can surely be like a jailhouse lawyer     be sit there figure out how be go to turn period of incarceration into an altruistic enterprise   be constitutionally incapable of buy illegal drug   have just never buy any illegal drug   anything have ever take have just be give to   khazan   the kind of shady nature of this   think   do discourage people from try because   not fun to try to acquire   waldman     so shady     true   the big thing say to kid   every time say goodbye to be   use a condom   test molly     because really believe that one of the most problematic side effect of criminalization be no one know what be take and especially now when   so much cheap and easy for criminal enterprise to create these   alphabetamines     some of which be incredibly dangerous   synthetic cannabinoid be just a nightmare   live in fear that one of kid be go to decide be go to take molly one night and end up ingest one of those   khazan   be still worried about get into legal trouble   have publish this book   waldman   so on november     be quite confident that nothing be go to happen   think   grandiose to imagine that be a high priority of jeff sessions   that say   have just elect a president whose attorney general be so retrograde   such a dinosaur in thinking about the drug war   that anything be possible   a consensus have form before this election that the war on drug be costly and ineffective   and simultaneously with elect donald trump and bring in jeff sessions   also legalize marijuana in a bunch of state   so   a really schizophrenic moment in history   so yeah   think   possible   khazan   notice that a couple time in the book when talk about experiment with people   the reaction be sort of mixed   almost feel like people be judge a little bit   now that   a little more public and there   a book about   be people still judge or have become more accepting   waldman   there be certainly people who will judge   some people say     oh that ayelet waldman   be confrontational again   be outrageous again     as if that be goal   the response from people who have deal with issue like depression have be overwhelming and wonderful   because even if have no interest in do something like this   know that other people who suffer from depression   from anxiety   from bipolar disorder   know what   like to be desperately search for a way to feel well   know parent      parent   be so wonderful and supportive and nonjudgmental   and judgment be build into the waldman dna even more assertively than mental illness   and be really wonderful   khazan   read that be not say when this take place   but to the extent that be able to share   have the effect last   how long do last   waldman     kind of interesting   the effect of the drug have not last   lsd do not hang around in system like that   but the effect of the end of the depression have last   have not cycle into as low as a mood since do not attribute that as much to lsd as to the insight bring about by that    experiment   even when mood have drop since then   have have a much clear image in mind of what not be depress be like   so that   one thing     allow since then to be somewhat less reactive and somewhat less impulsive   still feel as impulsive   but for some reason since then   and with a tremendous amount of work use all these other therapeutic modality that be bore and annoying but can be effective if use   have be able to put the brake on more inappropriate behavior   still make ton of mistake   will yell at husband   but do not have the same kind of fight really   do not build to the same kind of place   or if do know how to repair without go to a place of suicidal ideation   be in this therapy now that   call dialectical behavioral therapy   and for some reason since this experience have be more adept at the tool   and have be more able to force to do   that be say   if be legal   would still be do   no doubt

53359,73547,Former Intel Chief: Community Caught Between ’Scylla and Charybdis’ on Trump Dossier,Atlantic,Kathy Gilsinan,2017-01-13,2017.0,1.0,,there be two    highly sensitive document circulate in washington in early january   both relate to donald trump and the russians   the first   a classified report by the u  s  intelligence community   contain evidence of russian interference in the      united states election   which intelligence official have publicly conclude be intend to help trump win the presidency   the second   a    unverified opposition research report compile by a private intelligence firm   contain explosive personal and financial allegation about the    in some case allegedly gather by or in the possession of russian intelligence      the biggest intelligence questions raise by the trump dossier   and what have publicly link these two report of different genre be two page   that be the length of an   annex   append to the classify government document on russian election hacking   reportedly summarize some allegation from the other document   the private firm  s dossier on trump   and be a news leak about those two page that precipitate the publication of the full opposition dossier   though member of the intelligence community have be make aware of the dossier as far back as august        james clapper   the director of national intelligence   emphasize this week that the dossier be not       an intelligence community product       american intelligence official have neither produce nor verify the content of the report   but summarize part to provide policymaker with the   full possible picture of any matter that may affect national security       further confusing matter   appear a former british intelligence official do produce     as stanford  s amy zegart note   all intelligence be information   but not all information be intelligence   so what information qualify   and how do the intelligence community process or try to verify alleged information like what   in the trump dossier   speak about these and other question with dennis blair   who be the director of national intelligence   oversee the intelligence community   in      and        a condensed and edited transcript of conversation follow   kathy gilsinan   what distinguish the trump dossier from an intelligence product   dennis blair   an intelligence product be write to answer a specific question that   of interest either to policymaker or to operational leader in the field   and generally start with a particular intelligence requirement     what will isis do next     at the high end   down to   where be the ied in aleppo     on the low end   so the intelligence community do not just wander off and write about what catch fancy     try to provide information to help well decision   on the information that go into an intelligence report     a combination of intelligence that   gather through clandestine mean   whether be signal intelligence   where copy an email or tap a phone or human intelligence   where have a spy talk to or technical intelligence   like a picture that interpret     that   the information that go out and gather   and blend that with information that   available to most any expert in the field     database that be put together by academic institution or business in some case   observation from people in the field who be not intelligence officer   but be knowledgeable observer   start with those source of intelligence   and then have to come to some sort of an assessment of answer a question     here   where the ied be       this be what think isis will do     so that      percent of what the intelligence community spend time do   but occasionally   just in the course of     business   people in the intelligence community run across document or story that be just generally    that clearly be go to be of interest to policymaker   and when find something about the action of    that certainly fall squarely in that category   so then have to make a decision     generally at a high level in the intelligence community     as to what do with   gilsinan   so have this mysterious dossier from a private intelligence company that approach the fbi in rome   sometime in august in        generally speak   how would the community     the fbi in this case     process something like that   blair   would be turn into a field report describe how arrive   and then that context for how show up   would be forward   along with the document or evidence of other kind   and that would be send in a field report to the analytical center at headquarters   something this explosive and this big would be send at fairly high level there would be extra precaution take to make sure that   not widely disseminate   would get to leadership within the fbi and then in the intelligence community pretty quickly   gilsinan   suppose be some guy in rome in august      and go to the fbi with some explosive allegation that have totally make up   would that reach high level   how do know when to take information seriously enough to waste the boss  s time with   essentially   blair   that   a tricky one   would give     an initial screening   if the guy who walk in the door be drool      not make sense   and there be a lot of misspelling and typos in the document   would probably put in a circular file right away   but if   something that have a superficial veracity to and seem like may be true   if be sit there as the legal attach  in rome   say     wow   this be really hot     the main thing be that involve a u  s  citizen   and as soon as something involve a u  s  citizen   a whole different set of procedure   go   into play   whether involve the    or something come across with   kathy gilsinan  s   name on   simply can not be use     can not be put into a normal intelligence report   because the united states do not collect or report on americans   so there be two aspect of   number one   be about a u  s  citizen number two   be about      then the republican presidential nominee     for example   sometimes the nsa will obtain signal intelligence which say something about an american   or the nsa or cia have a spy report that talk about an american citizen   what   do in those case be that the identity of the citizen be block out in the original report   and then   determine   who that american really be require a set of extraordinary permission at a very high level within the community   but can imagine   if send this up say     go to     a hotel   would be pretty   thinly   that would actually be able disguise who be about   therefore would simply keep the whole thing in a very restricted channel   and send up to boss and say     what the hell do do with this     gilsinan   but can the fbi collect information on american citizen   blair   only if have a warrant   the only way the fbi could go out and collect the information on what americans be do overseas   for example   would be if go to a judge   and   get a warrant base on reasonable suspicion that a crime be be commit   in that case   could then conduct surveillance   put a listening bug into a room   but that   all do with the fbi     the    agency     and be either investigate a crime   or if have a suspicion   have to go through the warrant process that be all familiar with   and that   true for overseas investigation as well as for domestic one   gilsinan   and the fbi try to get a warrant in this case   blair   oh   do   gilsinan   try to get a fisa warrant   and the judge reject request   blair   good   good   the fisa system work   gilsinan   so then sound like there   not much could do to investigate this   right   the report that be read say     the fbi have be try to check this out and have not be able to verify anything     what be say seem to suggest that would not legally be able to check out anyway   blair   correct   understanding be that there   no evidence that a crime be commit   there   no suspicion   so do not have any ground to take any further   a field office would not sit on something like this and make up own idea   this would be handle at headquarters   base on what say and what know about   do not see any compelling rationale to investigate   that   stuff that reporter investigate   not the fbi   gilsinan   so there be the salacious allegation   but there be also allegation in the document of people in the trump campaign accept money or colluding with russia   which would be a crime   right   in which case the fbi could have investigate that   but would have still need a warrant   blair   have not read this document   if a document come across and say a crime have be commit   then the fbi have initial ground to investigate and there be thing can do without a warrant   just to choose   an   example   if a document that receive in an unexpected fashion say that a bank robbery occur a couple of week ago   then   worth check with the bank   and can do that without a warrant   but then the minute go further into have to take any action that invade the privacy of a suspect   then have to have a warrant   gilsinan   so hypothetically   the fbi could have ask the ritz carlton moscow     who show up          right   blair   yeah   be there a reservation in this person  s name on this date   that   sort of an easy one to check without violate privacy   and put in the ballpark of reality on something like this   gilsinan   but then would have to stop there   like   suppose the answer be yes   then what happen   blair   well   suppose the answer be     be not go to tell guest record be private     then would have have to have get a warrant   convince the judge be probable enough that could proceed   gilsinan   what   reaction as an intelligence professional about how this get out   be say that   within the intelligence community   this kind of thing would be very closely hold   and yet be bounce around dc for a couple of month   what   feeling on that   how could that happen   blair   the report be provide to several news organization in addition to the fbi   on the   question of   how do the information get out that   a briefing summarize the dossier  s conclusion   be provide to the      by intelligence official   guess look at two way   the way have always find most fruitful be the cui bono test   who would either get an advantage or get a kick out of leak   the people who know about   the briefing   within the intelligence community be pretty highly place   have be involve in public spat with the president       know   not good for or for the    or for future relationship   so why in the world would put this out and make life even more difficult   so what do that lead to   that lead to    people who know about but be not involve substantively and just get a kick out of see shitstorm in the paper and be able to say to buddy over a beer     know that big story   do that     that do happen   do have cipher clerk who handle   and secretary who set up meeting and so on   and have find over time that there be some who just get a kick out of read awful stuff in the press   as long as be who provide   and that could have be on the intelligence side or on the   side of      trump  s   transition team     the way do leak investigation be go through the real police detective work of   okay   let get a copy of every document   let trace every time be send   who be on the distribution list   every meeting in which be discuss     what be the attendance list   let go out and talk to all of     gilsinan   but   the document   could also have come from the private company or from the campaign be work for     not necessarily a leak from the intel community   what to make of the fact that the allegation be take seriously enough that official feel have to brief the president and the     blair   there be no more powerful force in washington than     what if this come out somehow and be find not to have do utmost     just think of the position that the intelligence leadership have be in for the last couple of week   be sure sit around and think     what if sit on this   and   come out somehow that be sit on     and   the    say     know about this and do not tell that be out there       those be the scylla and a charybdis that be catch between   and can very much understand a decision to provide to the     clearly   base on what have say   make all of the qualification of     have not investigate this this be not verify but boss   need to know this be out there     think make that call   rather than say     let bury this     because then think the chance within the intelligence community of a leak would be much great   especially in the fbi which have this sort of sense of entitlement among a lot of agent that know more than director do   be happy to tell news people how do happen all the time   gilsinan   anything else   blair   would just give one of blair  s law develop over the year   if there be a choice in explain a government action between a machiavellian   clever   ingenious plot to achieve that result and sort of blind   bumble      incompetence   choose number two all the time  
53360,73555,Why Europe Is Worried About Donald Trump’s Latest Remarks,Atlantic,Krishnadev Calamur,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,,   donald trump have not be shy about share view about the world   in general   and europe   in particular   be criticize during the presidential campaign for question the value of nato   praise the u  k   s decision to leave the eu   and link terrorist attack to the million or so    who have arrive in europe since        trump  s supporter and political analyst attribute those comment to    rhetoric   and say would pivot on these and other issue before the general election   but with less than a week before the inauguration at which will be swear in as the   th president of the united states   trump give a joint interview to the times   of london   and bild   the    german tabloid   during which describe nato as   obsolete     call the eu   basically a vehicle for germany     and say other country would follow the u  k   s lead and leave the bloc   trump  s remark about the atlantic alliance do not quite amount to the rejection of the group   nor do suggest the u  s  may abrogate treaty obligation to nato partner as appear to last july   indeed   when ask by the two publication if the u  s  would guarantee europe  s defense in the future   as have since the end of world war ii   trump respond     yeah   feel very strongly toward europe        very strongly toward europe   yes     but that come after call nato   obsolete     and note that only five of    member     the u  s  greece   estonia   poland   and the u  k      be spend share on defense   which under nato  s guideline constitute   percent of gdp   trump  s remark appear to conflict with those of james mattis   the retire marine corps general who be nominee for defense secretary   who say last week during confirmation hearing that   if nato do not exist today   would have to create     mattis accuse russian president vladimir putin of try to break up nato     and   that possibility that many european official fear   as well   russia  s invasion and annexation of ukraine  s crimean peninsula in        continued support of separatist rebel in eastern ukraine   speculation that have territorial design over the baltic state and scandinavian country   and support of syrian president bashar    have all lead to the belief that russian interest be at odd with western interest   traditionally   be the u  s  that be the bulwark against possible russian aggression in europe     and european leader fear trump will not keep that commitment   german foreign minister    steinmeier say trump  s remark   cause astonishment and excitement   not just in brussels     where both the eu and nato have headquarter   nato   say   have hear the comment   with concern     add     this be in contradiction with what   mattis   say in hearing in washington only some day ago and have to see what will be the consequence for american policy     trump  s past remark about russia have not elicit much confidence   either    s suggest would recognize russia  s annexation of crimea   praise putin as a strong leader   and appear for a time to take russia  s word that do not interfere in the u  s  election though the intelligence agency that will soon be run have repeatedly say the opposite   appear to suggest in late interview that would be open to lift sanction against russia in exchange for   some good deal       for one thing   think nuclear weapon should be way down and reduce very substantially   that   part of     say     but do have sanction and russia  s hurt very badly right now because of sanction   but think something can happen that a lot of people be go to benefit     then there   the future of the eu   the political establishment in europe and the u  k  be still reel from last summer  s vote by briton to leave the eu   although the nature of the u  k   s future relationship with the bloc be unclear   and the source of much political debate   the economic impact   so far   have be far from the catastrophe that be predict before the vote   trump be an early supporter of brexit     and interview this week with the times be give to michael gove   the u  k  lawmaker who be a lead campaigner for the   leave   movement   double down on early comment in interview        people do not want to have other people come in and destroy country     say   add later     people   country want own identity and the u  k  want own identity but   do believe this   if have not be force to take in all of the refugee   so many   with all the problem that   know   entail   think that would not have a brexit   probably could have work out but   this be the final straw   this be the final straw that break the camel   back     think people want   people want own identity   so if ask   other   believe other will leave     trump appear to be conflate thelongstande opposition to immigration among some u  k  voter to increase immigration to refugee policy   the u  k  pledge to resettle          syrian refugee last year   far few than other major european nation     though the fate of that commitment be unclear   trump also say in the interview that do not care one way or the other whether the eu be a single entity or several country   u  s  administration of both party have promote european unity for decade     though there have area of disagreement        personally   do not think   a strong eu versus strong nation state   matter much for the united states     trump say     never think matter   look   the eu be form   partially   to beat the united states on trade   ok   so   do not really care whether   separate or together   to do not matter     those comment   in particular   appear to have rankle in europe   where support for eu membership be high in most member state   even if there   resentment toward some eu policy   french foreign minister    ayrault say     the good response be european unity     speak in berlin   chancellor angela merkel say     europeans have fate in own hand     merkel come in for special mention in trump  s interview   criticize the german chancellor  s    policy for syrian refugee   call a   one very catastrophic mistake     also describe the refugee who be flee more than five year of civil war as   illegal     elaborate on those comment about merkel   who be face    this year and opposition after several terrorist attack in the country     think be a big mistake for germany     say of the policy     and           think should have build safe zone in syria             would have be a lot less expensive than the trauma that germany   go through now     john kerry   the u  s  secretary of state   criticize the remark     think frankly be inappropriate for a president elect of the united states to be step into the politic of other country in a quite direct manner     say on cnn     will have to speak to that   as of friday be responsible for that relationship     but of all the comment trump make in interview to the times and bild     remark about trade that be most likely to upset germany and other in europe     when ask about bmw  s plan to open a facility in mexico in        trump respond     would tell   do not waste time and money     unless want to sell to other country   that   fine     if want to open in mexico           but would tell bmw if think be go to build a plant in mexico and sell car into the u  s  without a    per cent tax     not go to happen     not go to happen             can build car for the u  s  but will be pay a    percent tax on every car that come into the country     the remark cause share in bmw and other german carmaker to fall   the eu be the u  s   s large trading partner   and as such german official would be likely to retaliate against a    tax on the automaker   sigmar gabriel   germany  s deputy chancellor and minister for the economy   tell bild in a separate interview that bmw  s large factory be already in the u  s    the u  s  car industry would have a bad awakening if all the supply part that be not be build in the u  s  be to suddenly come with a    percent tariff     say     believe would make the u  s  car

and mobilize resistance to jim crow   racist law and policy that disenfranchise black americans and mandate segregated housing   school   and employment   today   more than    year later   remnant of jim crow segregation persist in the form of mass incarceration     the imprisonment of million of americans   overwhelmingly and disproportionately black adult   in local   state   and federal prison   the u  s  incarceration rate be more than five time high than that in most of the world  s nation   despite a crime rate that   comparable to other politically stable   industrialized country   and among the swell number of incarcerated man and woman be a vast number of parent   in        the atlantic  s alia wong highlight a study from child trends that find that one in nine black child have have a parent in jail or prison   about twice as high as that for white child   for black adolescent age    through        nearly one in seven   predictably   this have implication for america  s classroom   in a new report   researcher from the    economic policy institute   epi   argue that mass incarceration be a chief contributor to the racial gap in academic performance between black and white student   the study outline a wide array of adverse effect for child of incarcerated parent and underscore how    policy and education policy be link   how parental incarceration affect a child  s education     education policymaker and many educator continue to insist that in order to narrow the achievement gap   must tinker with what be happen in the classroom           improve the way school be function     say the epi research associate leila morsy   the report      and a lecturer at the university of new south wales       yet   make change to    policy can make as much   if not more   of a difference   for child       acknowledge that a significant body of research already exist on the discriminatory system that incarcerate black man at six time the rate of white man   and about       time the rate of hispanic man   morsy and colleague train sight on   the disparate impact that this have on child   and how african american child suffer disproportionately     morsy say the epi study be the first of kind to compile all of the harm child of imprison parent suffer     academic   behavioral   and health impediment     and to draw a direct link between parental incarceration and child do bad in school   the report show that have an incarcerated parent translate to a range of learn obstacle and health challenge   after a parent be imprison   child  s    average fall   as the likelihood of drop out of school rise   compare to child of    parent   these youth show a high incidence of anxiety      percent more likely   and depression      percent   and be considerably more likely to be diagnose with    stress disorder      percent      hyperactivity disorder      percent   and behavioral issue      percent     the analysis also find that incarcerate parent lead to intergenerational trauma   child of incarcerated adult be at great risk for economic instability due to the loss of family  s main income provider   and as a result more often end up in foster care or homeless     both of which be significantly correlate to academic underperformance   the child of incarcerate parent be also more likely to find incarcerate eventually   repeat the cycle   importantly   morsy say   the report  s data take socioeconomic and demographic characteristic into account that could be use to mitigate the finding     include race   age   gender   parent   educational attainment   and poverty status     review study across a number of different discipline   like   epidemiology and sociology     say   add that because the study carefully control for factor that may contribute to poor outcome   suggest that   parental incarceration that   the cause           and not the quality of the child or the child  s family     interestingly   the report be heavily weight toward incarcerate black father despite shift gender trend in who be arrest and jail   in totality   far more man than woman be currently imprison   yet a study release last august by the vera institute of justice   a     think tank   show the number of woman in local jail     the majority of black or hispanic   and nearly    percent of mother     have grow    since        represent the    u  s  correctional population   additionally   an overwhelming majority of woman      percent   be jail for nonviolent offense   activist who work with incarcerated mom say the compelling and compound harm when mother be behind bar should not be overlook     the impact of incarcerate woman   who be very often the sole caregiver for child   be that those child be then displace   and effectively punish through separation     say holly krig   the director of organizing for moms united against violence and incarceration   an advocacy group in chicago   through work   krig have observe    how mother be underrepresented and ignore in the discourse surround incarcerate parent   which be even reflect in the visit that parent receive     father report far more visit from child when be incarcerate than woman do   the reason for that be because more often child continue to live with mother when father be incarcerate             the mother who ensure the kid continue to see father   when mom be incarcerate     far less often           the kid be more likely to be in the custody of either state foster care system or with a grandmother or another relative   without   the resource     to address this disparity   krig  s organization team up with local community leader to raise fund for bus trip to reunite child and mother incarcerate at logan correctional center   a woman  s prison about three hour southwest of chicago   launch on mother  s day        the monthly visit with rotate group of child have be critical for youngster and parent alike   kid who report the type of symptom summarize in the epi report     difficulty in school   nightmare   and stress     be experience some improvement     have be very intentional about create a space in which can talk about the underlie issue   where can address feeling of shame people have around incarceration     krig say   emphasize that the visit be   crucial for the survivability of whole family affect by incarceration   both the people who be incarcerate and   child       combat the negative impact of parental incarceration on child also fuel the work of morsy   the epi researcher and a former    teacher   time spend in bronx and east harlem classroom cement the belief that social condition of child outside school be inseparably connect to well performance inside school     and   one of those social condition   be   a fair    system     the report call for educator to make    policy the focus of advocacy at the local and state level by team with    reformer to repeal mandatory minimum sentence for drug offense and nonviolent crime   eliminate sentencing disparity   and increase support for release offender   morsy concede that the recommendation be   a start     not   a     percent solution   to discriminatory justice system   but view as a necessary and timely call to arm     educator advocate for and against charter school           for and against pay for performance for teacher   do not see that   different to advocate for policy that would improve student   outcome even if those policy be happen   outside   the education system     say   stress that take a stand to reform the criminal justice system be ultimately a      policy

valuable for young writer who maybe have not be around in an era where folk be ever really compensate well   have certainly write for free   would bet chee have do too   and think talk about that in essay   but if be hire to do work   need to pay   be sort of stance   and agree with that     percent      mention romanticizing that relationship between work and craft   think   very tricky because there be a lot of dangerous romanticization   and that can set writer up   particularly in the beginning of career   to blunder in a business know nothing about   chee have a great quote in essay where talk about how any education in writing should include an education in how to make a living as a writer   there be a place for the romantic in the writer  s life   but there   a difference between romance and be ignorant   gay say that really nicely in interview where   just like     do not want to kill the dream of student by be like       really hard to make a living       but   also the responsibility of old generation of writer to let folk know really what   like   drive equally crazy to read advice to writer on the internet that   like     here   how to write a bestseller in   step   or   be guarantee to get a book deal     think that   the flipside of the same coin   frankel   go back to chee   recall look at the life of writing mentor     tenured academic and literary magazine writer     as model for career   these model   write   have now become less attainable   how do think the financial prospect of writing have change over time   or affect the voice that get to be hear   martin   think anyone who be alive and of work age in even the     s have experience in lifetime     and be include in this     a decline in the ability to make a living as a writer   whether be write book or work as a journalist   chee and be around the same age   and also work in magazine in new york in the        and that part of essay ring very true to   there be people who be

journalism   that be a measurable truth   in the book industry     a little harder to measure because the industry be so wacky about advance   but do think that as become more difficult to make a living as a writer   a narrow selection of voice be be hear   and that mean a more limited pool of story be be tell   as be move into an era where the freedom of press be go to be severely restrict if not entirely threaten   think that question become even more urgent   frankel   in essay on own writing and working life   say       presume story be authentic when speak about work and art and say be once a seamstress     then introduce the idea of   writerly         a way writer with a degree of class privilege reshape story about own   day job struggle     what shape the way writer talk about   struggle     or relative lack thereof   martin   everybody have a story tell about to   and then everyone have a version of that story tell to the world   do not think writer be all that different     think everybody do this   maybe people do not articulate as well if be not people whose work be to articulate thing   what be do in that essay be to really call bullshit on own story   have this narrative of as a scrappy college dropout who make   when in reality   parent work in a university and have whole childhood   be    grow up   be definitely very poor for many year   but that be a poverty of choice   cheryl strayed   tiny beautiful thing   wild   talk about this in interview   be a very educated person   and so have choose to go into debt in order to do art and make work   but grow up very   very poor   as in like     poor   and so   very attuned to that difference   think   crucial for writer who be talk about struggle with money to be rigorous in examine own narrative   and make sure that narrative reflect reality   the legend of the   starve artist     think   on one hand can be very true   because have always live in a society and an economy that do not value the art monetarily in the same way that value other thing   on the other hand   let dig a little deep than that   and if be not actually starve let talk about that   frankel   jamison argue that all art be shape by outside force   include money and the institution that have   how do think the influence of these force like university and publish house play out in the kind of writing that see an audience   martin   think   those force   entirely shape what get see   these multiple influence that jamison talk so brilliantly about     money   institution   the influence of other artist   community or cohort     be huge     interesting because think jamison be argue that rather than institution destroy the integrity of work   be actually what make up the work   and think that   true to a certain extent   frankel   daniel jos  older   shadowshaper   the bone street rumba series   write that the language of economic     what   the market   demand     be use to obscure barrier that be in place for writer of color in publishing   be there other way the language of economics cover up the obstacle writer face   martin   the language of   quality   and   merit   also get use to obscure thing   there   an idea by publisher and editor that   only choose the   good   story to publish   that   only rubric   be look at story in a   pure   way   and only judge on value     that   just not how human work   and if be a person whose job be to edit or publish   have taste and feeling and opinion   and that go into what be choose   otherwise would be boring   but think that rely on the language of merit do not acknowledge the type of barrier     the racism   the sexism   the economic privilege     that be inherent in culture and society and   obviously   also in publishing   and in fact there be study that publishing be some crazy percentage white   right     editor   a study from january      find that the publishing industry as a whole be    percent white     that do not happen because only white people write good book   frankel   a lot of writer in this collection   include jamison and strayed   seem to be make a call for financial transparency from individual writer   how do think that great openness can shape the way people perceive writing as a career   martin   the only people who benefit from nobody in an industry know what each other make be the people at the very top   the people sign the paycheck   the people get the paycheck never benefit from that     hope that this kind of open conversation can have an empowering effect both on writer and people who want to be writer   while can be scary to confront      real talk   about money     essential   and could hopefully allow writer to have great control of the economic of business   the whole thing

53367,73562,Americans Can Soon Buy Groceries Online With Food Stamps,Atlantic,Adam Chandler,2017-01-15,2017.0,1.0,,last week   the u  s  department of agriculture announce an    pilot program that will give participant in supplemental nutrition assistance program   snap       best know by the colloquial term   food stamp       a way to purchase grocery online   the    trial   which will begin this summer   provide    americans in seven state with a system to have eligible item deliver to home through retailer like freshdirect   amazon   safeway   and shoprite and to pay for use federal benefit     online purchasing be a potential lifeline for snap participant live in urban neighborhood and rural community where access to healthy food choice can be limit     say usda secretary tom vilsack in a statement   the initiative be actually a provision of the      farm bill   which require the usda to test an online ordering program   if the pilot succeed   could expand nationally   which would theoretically provide more than    million americans who receive snap assistance with a new way to access healthy food   but despite clear benefit   particularly for those with disability   limited transportation   or the million of    americans in food desert   the success of the program be anything but certain   a number of factor include exist consumer habit   associate cost   and internet access could dim the prospect for the idea   while external opposition from lobbyist could potentially could block    adoption   in addition to good publicity   part of what lure seven retailer from maryland to iowa to oregon to apply to participate in the usda program be the chance to expand customer basis   and increase revenue   company from amazon down to         an    grocery      will collect delivery and service fee from these new transaction   fee that can not be pay for with federal benefit   the retail partner also offer a host of food item that be not eligible for snap fund   what this may ultimately beget be a dynamic in which the convenience of the pilot program be overshadow by the extra cost and logistical complication associate with delivery   along with the need for multiple form of payment snap user will need to complete an order   another challenge face the program be the demographic overlap between snap recipient and americans without internet access   a recent      pew survey show that those most likely to   lack regular access to the internet be    minority   particularly skew young and old   accord to federal datum   snap recipient     relative to the american population     break down along similar demographic line   with over half of federal benefit give to child and senior   meanwhile   roughly    percent of americans be primarily dependent on smartphone for internet access   which could hamper the ability to navigate a complex online ordering system   yet another hurdle may be geographic   while many tend to associate federal food assistance with urban poverty   the use of food stamp in rural community have be grow steadily in recent year   as rachel cernansky at civil eats note in        enrollment among americans eligible for snap be    percent high in rural area than in urban one   this disparity no doubt affect how and particularly where snap benefit be spend accord to the omaha      slightly more than half of all snap dollar be spend at superstore like walmart   which be not part of the pilot program     and aside from the logistical challenge   once unveil   the snap online purchasing pilot seem poise to face political opposition from association represent     store     who fear the program will cut into margin   follow the reveal of the state participate in the pilot program   local retailer that may be affect quickly condemn the usda initiative     with supermarket disappear from neighborhood in all five borough   this pilot program will only accelerate the trend     new york association of grocery stores spokesman brad gerstman say in a statement   meanwhile   in annapolis   cailey locklair tolle   the head of the maryland retailers association   tell the baltimore sun that have receive several call from business about the program     any time tinker with any part of the revenue for a grocery store   can literally send in the red very quickly     say   despite these obstacle   the big challenge to the pilot program may come from the intended participant   whose habit may be difficult to change   a      rand study shed some light on the preconception that access to healthy food   particularly fruit and vegetable   materially translate into well diet   the study find limited compelling link between food environment and food consumption   mean that the easy availability of quality food may not trump consumer preference for junk   and as note last month   large food company have also seek to step into this breach   offer more product with less fat and sodium   only to find that sell poorly   online   people be still likely to want what have always want

and the empire be get pretty ridiculous   inspire to take conviction more seriously           the folk at the living energy farm be not as confident that fellow americans be ready to take failure

do not buy gasoline   and do not pay anybody bill for energy     zeigler say       not coincidental that this free from corporate dependence     for part   zeigler do not think government be inherently bad   and do not identify as an anarchist       the problem with anarchism be not that the theory   in ideal sense   be break     that a lot of nitwit use that word     say     the idea

that eventuality     can build a mass movement tomorrow   no   and be not even worried about     zeigler say   but   can do that before turn the planet into easter island     but even within such

while the cambians be dismay by the election   have mostly strengthen conviction that should not be involve in politic     be embarrassed to say that feel like have to vote     benmoshe say     do not believe in democracy   so should have abstain   but feel like be really critical             well   that do not do any good     even though believe many people be unhappy within the current political and economic system   do not feel particularly call to engage in politic because of trump     there be a lot of people who feel isolated   who feel violate by capitalism in various different way     sutherland say     should be create an alternative   and that  s need now more than be need before     instead   most of energy be direct at build home     literally   follow practice call   natural

to be an activist anymore             require to rub against the thing that hate too much   and get sad and frustrated     cambia be not build to usher in a revolution   be build as a refuge         intentional community be   in own way   historical project   the original   city of refuge     find in the bible   be haven for people who have commit heinous crime   in early modern europe   religious separatist transform this idea   establish town where could await the imminent coming of christ   write the williams college art historian michael j  lewis in book   city of refuge   great thinker have long tell of socialist paradise and philosopher have ponder distant   lost society   in all of these community   historic and    utopian dreamer face the same question   be willing to engage at all in politic as be   or do wish to build the world anew   ironically   the deeply secular cambia come close to those old model of religious separatism that lewis chronicle in city of refuge   the historic group that most eagerly seek to escape the world be obsess with building geometrically pleasing   architecturally    town     physical manifestation of deeply hold value   there   in isolate hamlet   could experiment freely with social order and norm   safely separate from the world   perhaps   unfair to look to penalize utopia for fail to offer salvation   after all   people who live in these kind of community tend to be more politically active than the average american   say karen litfin   a professor of political science at the university of washington who have write about    around the world   and perhaps these community be not as immune from worldly flaw as may like   for example   many of struggle to be accessible to people other than    white folk   sky blue   a twin oaks resident who also serve as the executive director of the fellowship for intentional community   say there be   a lot of racial   problem   and racism that be embed in intentional community     even despite good intention     liberal white people who have a desire for diversity do not necessarily understand what mean to be inclusive     say     be go to create culture in     intentional community that be go to be comfortable for   which be not necessarily comfortable for people of color   or people with disability   or people who be gay or trans     ethan tupelo   a doctoral candidate at the university of massachusetts   amherst   who live at twin oaks before begin study intentional community academically   say resident talk about this issue a lot when be there       a bunch of white people sit around wonder where all the people of color be     say       nice that be think about that   but   also frustrating     tupelo see a structural explanation for the inaccessibility of intentional community   take a lot of cash to get off the grid     even when start a new community   need the capital to do in the first place if want to be a legally recognize thing   as oppose to squat     say   as nicolas and rachel sarah  s experience at the downstream project show   become untangle from capitalism also mean become much more vulnerable     tough to imagine a comprehensive way of replace health insurance   not to mention program like welfare   in a world without government   and then there be the tension between engagement and escape   in part of the environmental movement   of which many intentional community would consider participant   the impulse toward escape can be powerful   and dark   in a      essay for orion magazine     a piece nicolas specifically recommend     the writer paul kingsnorth argue that one of the thing    people should do at this moment in history be build haven     can think   or act   like the librarian of a monastery through the dark ages   guard the old book as empire rise and fall outside     write   litfin say do not think   possible for humanity to go back to medieval time   no matter how tempting that may be for some     in the dark ages   do not have the internet   do not have global travel   do not have climate change to any great extent     say     what have now be an embryonic global civilization that   totally ecologically   socially   and economically unsustainable             there   no escaping into own little enclave     some people use the term   lifestyle politics   to describe these community       the belief that if live value   then will be able to make effective change   or at least express political perspective     litfin say     think that   a good place to start   but if that   where end   actually do not have much impact at all     in own way   each of these community be try to change the world   albeit in small way   not everyone who seek utopia be like zeigler at the living energy project   though   people do not necessarily want to remake the world     the one thing everybody know about utopia be that mean   no place       lewis write   what   less    say   be that the greek word for   utopia   sound the same as   eutopia     a word with a different meaning     good place     for all struggle   this seem to capture the aspiration of virginia  s    utopias     be just these little worker build this giant cathedral     say nicolas     each of be just chip away at a little block   do not even have the    cathedral   but be do a

complex for republican brother in congress   most recently   in an interview with the new york times this week   trump singlehandedly throw the gop  s obamacare repeal process into chaos   insist that a repeal vote would come   probably some time next week   and a replacement   very quickly or simultaneously   very shortly thereafter     neither be correct   but especially the replacement timeline   congressional republicans   be quietly insist that will be week before a replacement bill be ready     maybe even month   or year          seek an escape hatch from trump  s america   the only person in the administration who seem willing to acknowledge this reality be vice    mike pence     in a press conference earlier this month   follow a meeting with republican lawmaker   pence say     the architecture of the replacement of obamacare will come together   as should   through the legislative process in the week and month ahead     to be clear   pence  s comment regard the replacement timeline be make before boss announce the   very quickly   very shortly thereafter   timeline for repeal   but pence be a former congressman and know well the reality of pass legislation     especially in the case of obamacare   where a replacement program will require    vote   in other word   democrats will need to be part of the solution   the question be   can mike pence mitigate the situation     bring boss down to earth   and maybe even help with outreach to the opposition party   while trump have make a point of share excitement and proclivity to an almost pornographic degree       nearly impossible not to know what trump  s opinion be on everything from vanity fair subscription to meryl streep to the late season of the apprentice     pence   constitutionally   remain more of a cipher   penny no doubt favor conservative policy   opposition to gay right and reproductive health service be well document   distaste for social welfare program equally so   but as concern temperament   negotiating style   leadership acumen     hard to know what kind of man pence be   other than a relatively quiet one   give trump  s inclination towards hostility   penny maybe the minority party  s good hope of break through to the white house     just as biden before   pence may be able to speak to adversary in congress more effectively than the president   in this     most useful   perhaps   to ask those who have work with   as colleague yoni appelbaum report at the gop convention this summer   indiana republicans have only glow assessment of the former leader     the single most important thing be how good a guy be     say one gop state representative   but what of indiana democrats     face with an uphill climb in a state legislature dominate by republicans   congressional democrats will find in a similar position   though in a narrow minority   and may use some guidance from those who have negotiate with pence before   state representative terry goodin   of the state  s   th house district   be the most diplomatic of the democrats speak with   goodin say   know the former governor for four or five year and concede that be   a little more proactive   with penny than most in party     even be in the minority   have have more personal dealing with     say   conclude nonetheless that     the governor stand firm for some of those thing believe in     the good way to get an issue resolve   advise   be to appeal to pence  s sense of bipartisanship     that make a little tasty     say goodin   ask about that appeal and how good to make     no different than the way would deal with anyone else     say goodin       the kind of person who be not reactive to a loud voice or a scream   be courteous     this all seem eminently    if not necessarily characteristic of the trump administration thus far   a focus on bipartisanship   courtesy and indoor voice   but then speak with former indiana democratic party chair ann delaney   who have know pence since congressional campaign in          what   like     say     one     quite personable   two     not aloof   three     easy to talk to     but continue     do not always think through the impact of what position will be     delaney cite pence  s foray into the hornet  s nest over the indiana religious freedom restoration act   rifra   which be sign into law by penny amid national outcry     that be not only a pr disaster     and permitted discrimination      but sign into law as be have the final four here     delaney recount     the medium from all over country be here     get a tremendous amount of play that would not have happen otherwise     penny   say be completely catch off guard   delaney do not appear think particularly highly of pence  s management skill     run the governor  s office   to       say     that   hard to do   crisis do not always occur between   to     do not think can be an active vice president and keep to that schedule     for democrats eager to use pence as a backchannel to either the administration     in the hope that may take case to the president   or own party   in the hope that may broker some bipartisanship   delaney be fairly grim       pretty firmly an ideologue   will do what   tell     say   as pertain to bring boss back to reality   representative charlie brown   from indiana  s  rd house district   be not optimistic   when pence be in the governor  s office   say brown     do not want to rock the boat       do not lay down the law     add delaney       just not strong enough     brown go further   say that pence have a hard time corral even own party   back in indiana     have some tough time with own caucus in both chamber     say brown     have a super majority and want to appear to be unite     but   say      problem arise     mainly because   pence   put religion first   that whole debacle over rifra be what sink   have a tiger by the tail   those be belief and can not take that away from   create havoc with business community     still   member of the minority party may at least expect a less confrontational tone from the veep  s office   especially compare to what may be issue forth from the man in the oval office   or twitter account       will not want confrontation on an individual level       say delaney     will be much more   in sorrow than in anger     will wring hand   say   to democrats   just can not bring   the rest of party   along     so be go to have to do this     and accord to goodin   pence  s decision be usually final     after make a decision   do not entertain much else     ultimately   say delaney   pence may not be all that constitutionally suit for the hurly burly of the trump administration     which   if the recent past be any indication   be likely to be a unpredictable and tumultuous ride     impress as someone who can deliver a message   speak well   hold own in front of the mic     say     but   much more comfortable with problem and solution on index card   and some of those problem and solution do not fit so well on index card

still pay for the crime never commit     on the hook for the            family agree to pay the bail bondsman who get out of jail two day after arrest   in maryland   as in the many other jurisdiction that rely on private bondsman and a money bail system   bail arrangement be private contract   unrelated to court outcome   innocent   guilty   or charge drop     as often be the case     the bondsman still collect fee       crazy     shaw say   but   the inevitable result of a privatized pretrial system dependent on a commercial    industry   the stated purpose of cash bail be to ensure that defendant show up in court and that dangerous people stay off the street   by require some amount of money up front and threaten further cash penalty   defendant be motivate to comply   or so the theory go   but   increasingly clear that cash bail do not accomplish these goal either fairly or efficiently   and that alternative that do not require defendant to pay for release be actually more effective   in the large swath of the country that still rely on cash bail     all too often the poor     not the dangerous or delinquent     who remain behind bar when can not afford to purchase freedom   those who do pay bail   like shaw   often find in another kind of prison   shackle for month or year to a debt that hobble opportunity to get ahead   and   the government   prod along by a powerful bail lobby   that enable the industry  s privileged position by provide a steady stream of client   by protect the industry  s right to collect   and by unthinkingly set bail amount that

   tell     like forever     one reason baltimore  s      industry be thrive be the sheer number of arrest every day   from january   to september             baltimore police make          arrest   include         in september alone     an average of    a day   most of those arrest be young black man   nor be baltimore an outlier in the zealousness     or overzealousness     of police force   thank in part to   zero tolerance   policy and other crackdown across the country   police make about        million arrest in        accord to the federal bureau of investigation  s uniform crime reporting statistics   only a fraction of these arrest result in prosecution   let alone in trial or conviction   some of this have to do with the lack of capacity on the part of prosecutor to keep up with the flood of arrest   but in baltimore   at least   many arrest be simply unwarranted to begin with   accord to a      investigation of the baltimore police department by the u  s  department of justice   local prosecutor throw out more than          charge between      and        because lack probable cause or otherwise do not merit prosecution     the justice department conclude that baltimore police habitually engage in unconstitutional stop   search   and arrest   often disproportionately target at minority   justified or not   these arrest be a principal source of traffic at the baltimore city jail   add to the scrum at central booking be another peculiarity of maryland law   the ability of any citizen to file a complaint with a    commissioner if police or prosecutor do not investigate   accord to a report by the state of maryland   more than four in    of the warrant issue by    commissioner in      be base on citizen complaint   which require no investigation beyond a swear statement by the complainant   all of these arrest be a great source of business for baltimore  s bail bondsman   who be a fixture in the city  s urban landscape     find a bail bondsman be like find a barber or a grocery store     say greg carpenter   the founder of  am bakery   a baltimore business that rehabilitate       where crime be really prevalent and people be go to jail every day   bail bondsman be as common as anything else     competition be fierce   despite a statutory prohibition on solicit business near jails   bondsman prowl the turf near central booking   look for desperate love one of people in lockup   shaw  s fianc e   destiny   tell be approach by several bondsman when go to visit shaw immediately after arrest     a lot of people come up to and say     be a bail bondsman       say       a hustle for     still   pay to choose the right bondsman   maryland law cap the fee a bondsman can charge at    percent of bail   some bondsman try to undercut the competition with   discount   on fee   other offer finance with just   percent down   shaw  s fellow inmate recommend a bondsman who be reportedly cheap     but in annapolis   unable to make the trip   shaw  s mom and fianc e choose the option close to the jail   the ironically name baltimore discount bonds   the price pay be like the price get when buy gas at the last station before the highway      contract   like the one the shaws sign   tend to follow a similar formula   provide that the fee charge     the   premium       be   fully earn   and   not refundable   once a person be release   also often give bondsman full access to all aspect of a bailee  s personal life   at lexington national   for example   one of the nation  s large    company   the standard contract available online give the bail agent access to all   credit report   social security records   criminal record   civil record   drive record   tax record   telephone record   medical record   school record   worker compensation record   and employment record     as well as the right to   attach a location track device on any vehicle own or drive   by the bailee   shaw  s mother   rosetta wise   tell be the principal guarantor on son  s bail contract   say the bondsman call every few week   threaten garnishment if the debt be not pay   once   shaw say   the bondsman come to offer a deal             now to wipe out the debt   could not afford   wise have be cover the last several month of payment while shaw and destiny try to get back on foot   shaw continue to work at    and destiny work in the flower shop and the deli at a local supermarket   but schedule be unpredictable and hour have be cut back   complicate matter further be that have a new baby   kay   who be four month old at the time meet shaw   in    visit at home   a dilapidated section      apartment in east baltimore with a bodega in the basement   the living room have a couch against one wall   an armchair   and a baby swing   where kay be nap in a fuzzy pink and purple    sleeper   a    tv   tune to disney junior   be the sole indulgence   there be one window   and no picture hang on the    wall that may once have be cream     there   no way can pull off     say shaw of the       payment owe each week   but bother that mother be pay the bondsman   and be a clear source of tension between mother and destiny   in a speakerphone call while be there   shaw  s mother and fianc e start dispute who pay what and how much     see what bail do to a family     shaw say     bail be similar to homeowner   or auto insurance     say jeff kirkpatrick   a bail bondsman in jackson   michigan   who be also executive vice president of the professional bail agents of the united states   a trade association     say go to jail for shoplifting or larceny and the judge set bail at                kirkpatrick tell     in most state   would pay    percent to    percent of that bond amount as a premium   in return   the bond agent be guarantee the court that should fail to appear and the bail agent fail to produce   would pay the court that                in truth   the   premium   pay by defendant cover the fee that bail agent pay to large insurance company to guarantee payment on a bail bond   if somebody jump bail   a bondsman call on insurer do not put up the cash or deed over house   bondsman be essentially broker for these big firm   in rafiq shaw  s case   for example   court file indicate that the surety of record be crum   forster insurance   a subsidiary of a    international conglomerate   fairfax financial holdings limited   crum   forster be one of    national insurance company and several regional insurance company that specialize in cash bail   many of be member of the american bail coalition   another trade association for the bail industry   the profit a bondsman make be the difference between the premium charge to a defendant and the premium the bondsman have to pay the insurance company   that give bondsman an incentive to ensure that client show up in court   forfeit a bond would have the same effect on insurance as total a car   kirkpatrick argue that this aspect of business be a public service     the bail agent do all the work do at no cost to the taxpayer     say       one of those    partnership that work really well   have do a very good job of make sure that suspect appear     but the big   risk   bondsman seem to assess be whether defendant can pay premium   while show like dog the bounty hunter have popularize the idea of fearless bondsman on the hunt for dangerous suspect      bail bonding have more in common with the sketchier side of the    industry than with law enforcement   the website of the professional bail agents of the united states include a page title   how to become a bail agent     half of the text be about choose an insurance company to back bail bond there be nothing about physical risk     the bail profession be probably more about whom know   or rather who know   than what know     the site say   moreover   police officer be often the one who end up do the work of find defendant who jump bail     of those that fail to appear     not bondsman who bring in     say steve chin   a pretrial service officer in mesa county   colorado   and spokesman for the colorado association of pretrial services     ninety percent of be be arrest by law enforcement   the only one see bondsman bring in be the one who have make an agreement with a bondsman for a fee and do not pay back     nonetheless   the bail industry have work hard to insulate position by pursue and win favorable legislation in the state   for example   while some state   like maryland   cap premium at a fix percentage   other state also set a minimum amount   eliminate room for price competition   in virginia   for example   state law require that bail bondsman   shall not charge a    premium less than    percent or more than    percent of the amount of the bond     some state have also pass law require judge to set money bail for certain kind of offense   such as domestic violence   thereby foreclose judge from other option   such as release on personal recognizance   for example   until the recent passage of    legislation that go into effect next year   new jersey require money bail for    offense   include murder and kidnapping but also resist arrest   theft by extortion   and   corrupt or influence a jury     many jurisdiction also rely on   bail schedule   that require fix amount of bail for particular offense with no discretion for judge   in los angeles county   for example   a charge of    robbery carry a mandatory bail of               other state grant bondsman grace period of up to two year before a bond be fully forfeit   in florida   for example   bondsman have up to two year to produce a    before forfeit a bond   even if the police happen to pick up a fugitive on a bench warrant   the bondsman still get a refund if   substantially attempt ed     to find a defendant   many of these    law be pass during the     s as the result of an extensive effort by the conservative american legislative exchange council to promote the    industry   the alec website still include model legislation for a variety of    bill   include variant of the legislation recently pass by new jersey to require bail for certain offense   the alternative method of court appearances act and the crimes with bail restrictions act   a replica of the florida legislation provide a grace period for bondsman to track down bail jumper   the bail forfeiture relief and remissions act   and a proposal require the expiration of bail bond after    month   the bail bonds expiration act     no one really know how big the commercial    industry be in the united states   some of the nation  s large    insurer be either    such as crum   forster   or privately hold   such as the american surety company   whose president be also chairman of the american bail coalition   a      study by the justice policy institute estimate that the industry write roughly      billion in bail bond per year   and the professional bail agents of the united states say that there be about          bail agent nationwide     if just want to make a lot of money   would get into the bonding business     say cherise fanno burdeen   executive director of the pretrial justice institute   a nonprofit research and advocacy group that oppose the use of cash bail       high profit and almost zero risk     in fact   the majority of people currently in the nation  s jail be defendant legally presume innocent and await trial   accord to the u  s  bureau of justice statistics             of the nation  s           jail inmate in        or    percent     be   unconvicted   defendant in pretrial status   up from roughly    percent of the nation  s           jail inmate in        most be unlikely to commit new crime or fail to show up in court   accord to a      survey by the national association of counties      percent of county jail administrator judge the majority of inmate to be     defendant   one reason for the rise in pretrial inmate be a rise in the use of money bail   the bureau of justice statistics report that judge set money bail on    of felony defendant in        compare with half in        much of the time   the bail amount be too high for a defendant to afford   even with the help of a bondsman   accord to the same bureau of justice statistics report   just one in    defendant with bail set at             or more be release   compare with seven in    for defendant face bail of            or less   one study of defendant in harris county   texas   find that    percent of felony defendant with bail of           or less could not afford to get out   as well as    percent of misdemeanor defendant with bail of       or less   the inability to afford bail can have serious collateral consequence for defendant   for example   research by the laura and john arnold foundation find that people detain pretrial be more than four time more likely to be sentence to jail than people who be release   more likely to be give long sentence   and more likely to be recidivist   people in jail be less able to meet with lawyer   point toward important witness   and put together the good defense   the disruption result from stay in jail may mean the loss of a job or housing   which lead to economic instability or other consequence that could prompt a rearrest   people in pretrial detention be also more likely to plead guilty before the trial   because that may be the only way to avoid spending month or year in jail await time in court   in baltimore   defendant who can not make bail within    hour of arrest be entitle to a bail review hearing   which take place every morning at    at the district court on wabash avenue   at the hearing   a judge review the district court commissioner  s initial bail determination to decide if the bail amount should be change   similar proceeding take place in many other jurisdiction around the country   and in baltimore   at least   the result be yet one more level of capriciousness in the    system   while hearing take place in district court   the defendant be still in lockup at central booking   appear in court via video on a screen at the left wall of the courtroom   this mean that defendant who have question for attorney can not confer with counsel in private   the resolution be grainy   and what see be about a dozen man in yellow jumpsuit   mostly black or hispanic   seat four at a time in row of fold chair with one empty chair up front   individual face be too difficult to make out     which be perhaps fitting   give the routinize nature of each hearing   under maryland law   the judge who hear bail review be suppose to consider a variety of factor in decide the condition of a defendant  s release   these factor include not just the nature of the crime charge   but also the defendant  s family tie in the area   work history   and prior record of appearance   as well as the recommendation of pretrial service   prosecutor   and the defendant  s own attorney   but within this structure   judge have immense discretion     matter so much who the judge be     baltimore assistant public defender nila bala   one of the attorney assign to bail review   tell     that matter more than anything else     more than the client   the charge     the state  s attorney   or any other factor   and the judge vary widely in what will do in certain case     to defend client   bala drive to central booking at      every morning to interview the client who be due for hearing that day   have about an hour to speak to dozen client

myriad of problem cause by money bail   abolish   what happen instead to defendant await trial should depend on actual risk to public safety and the odd of be a    in court   under a     system such as this   judge first decide whether a defendant be safe enough to release pende trial   dangerous defendant stay in   while    defendant get out   the condition of release for these    defendant   however   would depend on the likelihood of flight or rearrest   for example   some defendant may be require to check in weekly with a    officer   while other may simply be release on own recognizance   still other may be require to post a money bond   but the amount would depend on ability to pay   the state that have already move or be move to such a    system be kentucky   colorado

constitutional amendment prohibit the detention of defendant solely because of inability to pay bail     in the district of columbia     which long ago effectively eliminate money bail     the pretrial justice system have come under fire for    mistake in release defendant due to what the washington post editorial board characterize as the lack of   a sound system that use reliable datum to assess risk       one factor drive this current wave of bail reform be new research finding that alternative to    money bail work better to ensure that defendant show up in court   a      study by the pretrial justice institute   fund by the department of justice   find that   unsecured   bond   which require no money up front but be due in full if someone skip town   be just as effective as traditional cash bail in ensure court appearance and preventing rearrest   in a control experiment in colorado   defendant release on an unsecured bond   regardless of risk   be less likely to commit new crime than defendant release on traditional money bail   and all but the    defendant be more likely to show up in court   a      study fund by the justice department also find that simply mail defendant a reminder to show up in court significantly reduce the number of people who fail to appear   in an experiment involve more than         misdemeanor defendant in nebraska   only       percent fail to show up after get a mail reminder about court date   along with information about what would happen if fail to show   by comparison          percent of defendant who get no such reminder be     a second factor drive bail reform be the emergence of new    tool     know as   risk assessment instrument       to help judge decide whether a defendant should be release into the community and on what condition   these instrument be help make a     alternative to cash bail viable   in colorado   for example   which pass    legislation in        many judge now use the colorado pretrial assessment tool   or cpat   a    matrix that assess a defendant  s risk of flight and danger to the community use such variable as age of first arrest   prior failure to appear   and current    issue or alcohol and drug problem   although colorado still have a commercial    industry   have shrink dramatically since the passage of the new law   say steve chin of the colorado association of pretrial services   in mesa county   where chin work   the use of traditional money bail fall from    percent of case in      to    percent in      without any increase in rate of failure to appear or new crime commit by defendant release into the community   a third factor drive reform be that state be realize how expensive be to house all these inmate await trial   especially when so many of be       accord to the arnold foundation   the cost of pretrial detention alone be at least     billion a year   alaska   for example   pass bail reform in the spring of      as part of a sweeping    reform effort after legislator see that the state  s large prison     the goose creek correctional center in point mackenzie     be already run out of room after opening in        accord to a report by the alaska criminal justice commission   alaska  s jail population be grow at three time the rate of overall population growth in the state   much of this growth be in the pretrial population   which grow    percent over the last decade   this growth   the commission find   be drive by reliance on cash bail     prison population trajectory be such that would have to build another prison within the next four year     say state senator john coghill   the lead sponsor of alaska  s reform   with the state already spend nearly    percent of budget on correction   build yet another prison be unpalatable to lawmaker   as a result of all this activity   momentum be grow at the national level   too   earlier this year   california democratic representative ted lieu introduce legislation that would require state to abolish cash bail as a condition of receive federal grant support for state and local police   in december        the white house convene a conference on excessive fine and fee in the    system that also include a look at cash bail   aspect of money bail be also under fresh judicial challenge   a pending    suit in the eleventh circuit court of appeals   walker v  city of calhoun   be challenge the constitutionality of bail   schedule   like the one in los angeles county   in an amicus brief file on behalf of the plaintiff   an indigent georgia defendant name maurice walker   the u  s  department of justice argue that   bail practice that incarcerate indigent individual before trial solely because of inability to pay for release violate the fourteenth amendment     and in maryland   home to rafiq shaw   the state attorney general release an advisory opinion in october      conclude that the state  s current    system could be unconstitutional   on the ground that impose bail defendant can not afford may violate the eighth amendment  s prohibition on   excessive bail   and the fifth amendment  s guarantee of due process   in late november   the standing committee on rules of practice and procedure of the maryland court of appeals recommend overhaul the state  s bail system   a significant first step toward reform and one that have take advocate year to achieve   by eliminate cash bail   state can ensure that poverty be not the only reason a defendant stay behind bar   and can end the predation of    defendant by a commercial    industry motivate more by profit than by protect public safety   get rid of money bail would also stop the absurdity of case like rafiq shaw  s     where an innocent man be pay for the mistake of prosecutor and police     bail be not fair     say shaw   who be now work to get arrest record expunge so can find a well job     be not guilty   the case be over     the era of cash bail should end

 americans be widely regard as the most optimistic people on earth     elite be more prone to overconfidence   whether be    chess player or master of the universe on wall street   give all this   donald trump seem almost uniquely likely to succumb to hubris   not only be male   american   and a member of the elite   for all talk of populism   but also instinctively respond to challenge by come out swinge   and be prone to narcissistic or arrogant behavior   such as declare do not need daily intelligence briefing   where say would hear   the same thing in the same word every single day

but do have a cabinet   trump once say that may not come to the aid of nato ally   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell seem unworried because trump  s adviser would take a different perspective     do not think that view would be prevalent or hold by anybody may make secretary of state or secretary of defense     but will trump listen to team   research show that inexperienced president often rely on a narrow range of adviser   and may not defer to those more experienced for fear of look weak   and   not clear that the incoming national security adviser   the retire lieutenant general

53374,73576,Obama and the Limits of ’Fact-Based’ Foreign Policy,Atlantic,Shadi Hamid,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,be the good and the bright   but   most of all   believe be right   although the scale of disaster be considerably different   the same that be say of those who oversee foreign policy under presidents john f  kennedy and lyndon johnson could be say of the obama administration   these be academic   intellectual   and technocrat who be not only very smart take pride in be practical   ground in reality   and wed to fact   after the suppose    and ideological rigidity of the george w  bush administration   many of welcome the prospect of a president who be cerebral and professorial   even those sympathetic to president barack obama  s    instinct   however   will agree that do not quite go as plan   the obama doctrine   the very notion of   fact   have be demean by republicans   and most of all by team donald trump   as trump surrogate scottie nell hughes put     there   no such thing   unfortunately anymore   as fact     in response   democrats have double down on tendency to wield fact as cudgel   demonstrate righteousness in the process   would be a loss   though   if this come to be see as merely another partisan schism   as turn out   obama  s    legacy can offer an important window into whether fact     and be         be quite as critical to    policy success as may like to think   unlike kennedy and johnson   obama be very much the     set the tone for the people would surround with   intelligence be generally in little doubt   during eight year in the oval office   the president be an almost unbelievably voracious reader   devote around an hour on most day to book of history   philosophy   biography   or even    novel   but be smart and    do not necessarily lead to good judgment or bold vision in some case   even   the former can undermine the latter     the good and the bright   enter the american lexicon   with more than a hint of irony   through david halberstam  s landmark book on the man who drag america into the vietnam war   in foreword to the book   senator john mccain write of these man     misjudge the world   and   most of all   misjudge     matter of judgment still loom large four decade later     or any critic of obama  s foreign policy   could sit with an obama administration official   and   even if agree on all the fact and specific of a particular country or conflict   would not matter much   divergence in how people interpret obama  s legacy have much more to do with fundamentally different start assumption about america  s role in the world and even human nature     in other word   the very reason why do what do   in fact   look back at own meeting with official during the obama era   rarely do ever recall hear something and think to that have just hear some gross error of fact   this be why find such meeting so frustrating and circular   the only thing disagree on be the most important   for example   have little disagreement with the technical aspect of the iran nuclear deal   the problem   well before negotiation even start   be the initial decision to treat iran  s nuclear program as the top u  s  priority in the middle east   on syria   opponent of intervention against the assad regime would often claim that various military option be prohibitively difficult to implement   and that those who claim otherwise be not military expert   of course   obama be not a military expert either   either way   the claim be disingenuous   senior military official have readie a military response to assad  s violation of the   red line   draw over the use of chemical weapon in august        and with no notable dissent   ultimately   the divide over syria be about deep question of moral responsibility   america  s role in the world   and whether an intervention would be   worth   the cost   something which   of course   can not actually be measure     as steven a  cook write in early      when only around         people have be kill in syria     be a morally superior position to sit by as people be be kill rather than take action that will kill people   but nevertheless may end up save life as well     be obama   at the   th hour   who   come to own very personal answer   abruptly reverse course   this   like the decision to prioritize the iran deal over all else   be no accident of history   there be   in fact   a set of basic   overarch idea that appear to animate obama and most loyal aide   which come through in any number of interview and profile   include what nina hachigian and david shorr call the   responsibility doctrine       the idea that step back allow other to step in and take responsibility for own region   in the middle east   though   the success of such an approach depend on have ally that share american interest or american value   when   in reality   most share little of either   due to the formative experience of the iraq war   as well as domestic political consideration   obama hope to reduce america  s footprint in the middle east   this mean a general bias toward disengagement   irrespective of whether great u  s  involvement could produce well outcome in particular crisis   even the iran nuclear deal be basically about remove the possibility of an american war with iran     there be also a general discomfort around the direct use of u  s  military force   a discomfort which be as ideological as be practical   these start assumption seem colored as much by objective assessment of fact as by obama  s distinctive     and seemingly        perspective around human nature   as michiko kakutani note   obama have think deeply about these thing     during   obama  s   last two year in college   spend a focused period of deep    and study   methodically read philosopher from st  augustine to nietzsche   emerson to sartre to niebuhr   to strip down and test own belief     some of these view be just as applicable to domestic issue as be to foreign policy   in    coate  s profile of barack obama  s evolution on race   there be a number of recur theme   a    optimism that make more difficult to process defeat   or   for that matter   evil and a set of assumption about the inherent rightness and rationality of the american people   include adversary   as coates write   obama   who experience relatively little direct racism in own life     appeal to a belief in innocence     in particular a white innocence     that ascribe the country  s historical error more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism     evil   then   be something outside of history   a history which   obama like to remind people   bend toward justice   obama often seem annoyed with other   resistance to this march of historical progress   want other   friend and enemy alike   to act rationally in what think be own interest   iran   after a deal   would be more likely to play a constructive regional role israeli leader do not realize that the iran nuclear deal be in own interest   but would surely come around russia   after aggressively intervene in syria   would soon come to see the error of way     think mr  putin understand that           with afghanistan fresh in the memory   for to simply get bogge down in an inconclusive and paralyze civil conflict be not the outcome that   look for     obama comment     president obama also disparage arab   tribalism     a    word that capture not just impatience with tribalism   narrowly understand   but the uncontrolled passion of ideology   identity   and religious fervor     if only everyone could be like the scandinavians   this would all be easy     obama be know to say to aide   but no one   apparently even scandinavians   could be like the scandinavians   obama   cool rationalism and emotional remove could easily devolve into disdain   whether disdain toward middle eastern ally or disdain toward donald trump and electoral prospect   as tenure wind down   obama seem as resistant as ever to adapt view   despite everything that have happen under watch   whether at home or abroad   the president believe that history move with   but in an era of resurgent ideology and nationalism   be the one who increasingly seem like an outlier   out of place and out of time

camp   perhaps   the government have hint   on abandon army basis     and once prisoner be there   the government would face a dilemma   because the fifth amendment  s due process clause apply to all

some may have be detain because of a confusion of identity   some may have other equitable reason that would lead the government to allow to stay     must have a chance to contest the allege ground for removal   and a request of some kind for judicial review   but many do not seek right   may not know about have no right to counsel     or may find the condition of detention unbearable   can be offer the alternative of something something call   voluntary departure     under this heading   alien agree to leave and pay own way home   the   advantage   be that an alien who accept will not be detain   and remain at least formally qualified to    illegally   in practice   say colleague elizabeth keyes of the university of baltimore law school     voluntary departure have be a bad deal   since first begin to be offer   a person who have depart voluntarily may not apply to come back for at least ten year   and may be subject to exclusion when or finally can apply   voluntary departure   however   be great for the government   alien may more easily be persuade to take if can be keep in isolate detention compound   far from family   community member   and potential counsel     and possibly subject to mistreatment by the jailer   jennings   the first case   now pose the question whether the government can hold people await deportation indefinitely   pende hearing   two circuit     the ninth and the second     have hold that alien be entitle to a bail hearing and to release while case or appeal be pende   base this holding on statutory language     but that be at good   for the alien   point of view   unclear after hear an argument about the statute   the court issue an unusual order on december    direct the party to brief the constitutional issue   can the government hold alien indefinitely if be potentially deportable   for that matter   can hold anyone indefinitely when the person be not charge with a crime     watch the space below for outraged comment that

  not few   right     include a right to counsel and often a right to a bail hearing     the constitutional issue be make more portentous by the fact that a republican congress could decide to pass legislation strip statutory guarantee above from some or all of the undocumente who fall into the icy hand of homeland security   but can not repeal the constitution   the answer to that question may mean a lot when the tumbril of the   deportation task force   begin to roll   immigration law already give ice wide power over people who fall into maw will there be an appetite to give more   the second question be whether the government can make detention so miserable that alien will go on own   that issue be implicate by a case to be hear wednesday   ashcroft be actually three case all arise

of justice have establish beyond question that the alien be hold under brutal condition and subject to discriminatory treatment by officer at the federal detention center     one   for example   be hold in solitary and subject to such harassment that could not be transfer to the general population because be   be cry too much       after thirteen year of bounce around   under various name   in the low court   the plaintiff win a preliminary victory in the second circuit   that court hold that complaint against the high official could go to a full trial under a federal case call bivens v  six unknown name agents of the federal bureau of narcotics   that case permit lawsuit against federal official who violate   clearly establish   right   the court have   over the year   narrow the availability of bivens   expand the official immunity of federal actor   most handicapper regard victory for the alien as unlikely     especially since two of the court  s    justice sonia sotomayor and justice elena kagan   be recuse   apparently   because have some contact with the case before come on the court   so a    victory for the government be likely   but be there a single conservative justice who may be able to imagine what indefinite detention   and expand immunity   could mean in conjunction with a new administration commit to a new version of operation wetback          or even the japanese internment   may such a justice write an opinion qualify the result   or be business as usual at first st  ne   even as the sky fall everywhere else

53380,73582,"Trump’s Interests vs. America’s, Vornado Edition",Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,2017-01-17,2017.0,1.0,,   donald trump  s promise to erect a big   beautiful wall between and business last slightly more than    hour   almost exactly two day after the january    press conference at which trump announce plan purport to disentangle from namesake business   the huffington post report that the    have schedule a meeting with steven roth   roth   a fellow new    billionaire    developer   be in charge of vornado realty trust   an investment firm that    two of trump  s most valuable property   one in manhattan and one in san francisco   and serve as an economic adviser during the campaign   what trump and roth discuss at meeting remain unknown   nor be clear when exactly the meeting be schedule   regardless   that the meeting come directly on the heel of the press conference at which trump and lawyer lay out a plan supposedly mean to resolve conflict of interest   throw the reality of the problem that come from have a businessman as president     and one who seem completely uninterested in take step that would actually distance from business     into sharp relief   shortly thereafter   the wall street journal report that roth may soon become involved with the trump administration beyond just    friendship and partnership with the     trump   seem   will soon be name roth and richard lefrak   yet another new    billionaire    developer   to oversee a council of    to    builder and engineer who will be carry out the    s     trillion infrastructure proposal   a situation which provide ripe opportunity for the pair to direct federal dollar toward project from which will financially benefit   this news come on top of a december report in the washington post that roth  s firm have put in a bid to rebuild the fbi  s headquarters   a deal that could be worth as much as     billion   in other word   trump   mere day after promise to remove from business   be instead usher a longtime partner into administration   the move could also end up provide yet another avenue by which trump could enrich in office and by which other could attempt to curry favor   whether or not intend to do so   the    s decision to place roth at the head of such a large pool of money send a signal to other company about the continue intermingling of business and presidency   that work with the trump organization can be a path to increase influence or even appointment   and though trump claim that will no longer be in involved in     operation   will be actively profit off from the company   mean that will be personally make money off of the attempt of other to gain influence over american public policy   the background      donald trump will not be take necessary step to resolve conflict of interest before take office   at press conference on january        first since june          trump and lawyer sheri dillon lay out the plan that claim would resolve the question about conflict of interest that have dog the    since be elect   instead   what announce be piecemeal step that   though design and package to mitigate the appearance of conflict of interest   do almost nothing to substantively address concern that business entanglement will undermine ability to faithfully execute the office of the presidency   the first of these step   presage by numerous report from both within and outside the trump organization and transition team   be to relinquish official leadership role within company   in stead   trump  s two adult son   donald jr  and eric   will be run     operation with a longtime associate of father  s   with what so far amount to a    assurance that will not discuss any aspect of the business with the     as have be previously write numerous time   such an arrangement do nothing to actually mitigate conflict of interest trump  s relationship to son   who be member of transition team   among close adviser   and   perhaps most importantly   child   be far too close for state arrangement to qualify as a blind trust   additionally   dillon  s description of how trump will divorce from knowledge of dealing do little to resolve the overarch problem of    knowledge of empire   the president  s holding both in the united states and around the world be vast and highly visible be unreasonable to assert that reduce official report to just the company  s overall profit and loss will prevent from know if a policy or position will be beneficial to company   a problem to which dillon allude by assert that the      can not    own trump tower     similarly   trump intend to create two position   one within the government and one within company   to act as ethical watchdog over behavior   these role offer little reassurance unless the    or someone on team spell out a    way by which trump will be hold to these standard   in fact   arguably the only one of the many step trump and dillon announce that will actually reduce the potential for conflict of interest be pledge that the trump organization would be pursue no new foreign deal while trump be in office and   accord to a press release from trump  s law firm release after the conference   will terminate several deal that be currently underway   however   consider that trump have previously promise no new deal   period   and consider the numerous property around the world will still own   the promise do little to assuage concern that trump  s business will influence presidency   dillon offer two preemptive defense against the ethical and legal question that trump be likely to take once take office   the first be a reading of the    emoluments clause of the constitution   which make illegal for federal officeholder to   accept of any present   emolument   office   or title   of any kind whatever   from any king   prince   or foreign state     accord to dillon   agent of foreign government stay at trump hotel do not violate this clause because do not apply to     exchange     and   no one would have think when the constitution be write that pay hotel bill be an emolument     this   should be say   be a minority position   numerous expert   most notably norman eisen and richard painter   who serve as ethic lawyer for president barack obama and george w  bush   respectively   and the constitutional law professor laurence tribe   have already voice disagreement in no uncertain term   state without reservation that trump  s continued ownership of property will violate the constitution the day enter office   moreover   the workaround trump  s legal team have apparently create     donate profit from foreign government   payment to the u  s  treasury     do nothing to change the fact that government will likely attempt to curry favor with the president through hotel   as may view that as flattering   not to mention the hotel will still collect revenue on the stay   second defense be one that trump have repeatedly assert since the election   the law bar    official from maintain financial holding or business tie that overlap with duty do not apply to the president or vice president   in this regard   be correct the law   pass in        exempt the two chief executive from     rule on the understanding that purview be so broad that would be almost impossible for to completely disentangle   regardless   legality do not imply propriety   unless trump act to put actual distance between and business venture     and today  s press conference seem to indicate that will not     these question will likely continue throughout time in the oval office   already   the director of the office of government ethics   michael shaub   have declare trump  s plan insufficient   remark     do not think divestiture be too high a price to pay to be the president of the united states     and a number of senate democrats have introduce legislation that would force trump to divest or face impeachment   below be an attempt to catalogue the more    example of conflict of interest that have emerge so far the most recent entry appear at the top   those indonesian politician   despite    donald trump  s assurance that have stop pursue deal since the election   namesake organization apparently move forward with a pair of project in indonesia   accord to the new york times   the two property that will bear the trump name   one overlook a hindu temple in bali and the other abut a theme park in west java   present ethical problem even before the election   to begin with   through indonesian partner on the project   the billionaire medium mogul hary tanoesoedibjo   know in indonesia as hary tanoe   trump have forge relationship with several top indonesian politician   one such leader be setya novanto   the speaker of the country  s house of representatives who temporarily lose post for try to extort     billion from the american mining company      a company which count carl icahn   who will be serve as a special adviser in trump  s administration   among large shareholder   and which have be frequently criticize by labor advocate and environmentalist     trump have lunch with novanto and several other indonesian politician during the campaign in september      to discuss the trump organization  s plan expansion into indonesia   at a    press conference   trump pull novanto in front of the camera   call   an amazing man   and   one of the most powerful man   and assert     will do great thing for the united states       be unclear exactly whom trump mean when use the word         trump then ask novanto to confirm that   like in indonesia     which novanto do   another of the politician who attend the lunch with trump be fadli zon   the vice chairman of indonesia  s house of representatives   whose district include one of the city in which one of the    property will be build   accord to the australian broadcasting corporation   zon be associate with a political movement seek to unseat and jail the current governor of jakarta   basuki tjahaja purnama   also know by nickname   ahok   and have speak at rally against ahok   the    movement be root partly in century of ethnic tension within the country   ahok be both christian   which have make the target of attack by hardline cleric claim to represent indonesia  s muslim majority   and a member of the country  s historically oppress chinese minority   which be the target of a massacre in        aside from an interim governor appoint half a century ago   ahok be the first governor of jakarta to fall into either category   and be currently on trial for blasphemy for allegedly insult the koran   although ahok  s supporter claim that be ahok  s accuser who be guilty of blasphemy for denigrate ahok  s christianity   both trump  s question to novanto and zon  s presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the    introduce into the united states   relation with indonesia   indonesia be both the large predominantly muslim country in the world and the nation with the large population of muslims   novanto receive significant blowback for statement that   yes   indonesians do like trump   because turn out that   no   many indonesians do not like trump   in large part because of      proposal to ban muslims from immigrate to the u  s  in fact   face with mount criticism   novanto  s party apologize not only for novanto  s statement but also for mere attendance at the luncheon   since trump  s victory   both novanto and zon have stand up for the    arguing that trump  s hardline stance toward muslim immigration be merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the    s own belief   something novanto claim trump personally assure be the case   regardless   be clear that the trump organization  s plan expansion into indonesia     which   again   be the reason trump meet with novanto and zon in the first place     could introduce major complication into the relationship between the    and the political leader of the world  s large muslim country   not to mention a significant trade partner and an important ally in the south china sea region   as if that be not enough   tanoe have show increase interest in become involve in indonesian politic   in        tanoe publicly support the retire general prabowo subianto in the nation  s presidential election subianto lose to the country  s current leader   joko widodo   then   in        help find a new political party   the united indonesia party   or partai perindo   which intend to field candidate for national office in the near future   include tanoe   shortly after the new york times report on the project   tanoe tell the australian broadcasting corporation that     if there be no one can believe who can fix the problem of the country   may try to run for president     if tanoe do so   will create the possibility that trump will be deal with a head of state with whom have share business interest   which   as richard painter tell the new york times     make impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner       especially consider that   after trump  s election   stock in tanoe  s company rise significantly   moreover   tanoe   like ahok   be both christian and ethnically chinese   which some insider consider an obstacle to electoral chance   although tanoe argue that be not ahok  s religion but lack of firm leadership that have lead to the    protest against the governor   nevertheless   if tanoe do choose to run for office   be difficult to see how race   religion   and business partnership with a    many see as blatantly islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulty both within indonesia and in the country  s relationship with the u  s    since trump and lawyer announce on january    that the company would be suspend unfinished development project and pursue no new foreign deal   the current state and eventual fate of the project in indonesia be unclear   regardless   have already create a remarkably complicated situation among the    and politician and businesspeople involve in the country  s political scandal and ethnic

gerhardt even high   and if be   be too high to drive safely   this month lawyer argue before the state  s high court that french prove neither that night   massachusetts be one of eight state   plus the district of columbia   where recreational marijuana use be now legal   twenty more state have legalize use of medical marijuana   but science and the law have not keep pace with this rapid political change   take for grant that not be able to walk a straight line or stand on one leg mean that be drunk   and that be drunk mean   unacceptably dangerous to drive   but there be no clear scientific consensus when come to smoking pot and driving   and few of the tool police officer have long rely on to determine whether a driver be too drunk to drive   like a breathalyzer   exist for marijuana   case like gerhardt  s be on the front line of a new effort in courtroom   lab   and government agency around the country to pin down how high be too high to drive     and how to reliably know when someone be as high as that   most   but not all   study find that use pot impair one  s ability to drive   however   overall   the impairment appear to be modest     akin to drive with a blood alcohol level of between      and        which be legal in all state     the much great risk be in combine pot with alcohol     the increase crash risk with pot alone   be so small can compare to drive in darkness compare to drive in daylight     say university of oslo political scientist rune elvik   who conduct several major    evaluate the risk of drugged driving     nobody would consider ban people from drive in the dark   if try to impose some kind of consistency standard   then there be no strong case   really   for ban     when come to alcohol   science and the court have long establish a direct line between number of drink   blood alcohol level   and crash risk   as one go up   so do the other   not so for pot   scientist can not say with confidence how much pot   in what concentration   use in what period of time   will reliably make someone   high       this be especially difficult to gauge because most of the exist study use pot provide by the national institute on drug abuse   which tend to be a lot less potent than what smoker can buy on the street or in pot shop     blood level of thc     tetrahydrocannabinol   the chemical component of pot that make high     spike quickly after smoke and then decline rapidly in the hour afterwards   during the window when a smoker would feel most high   what   more   regular smoker could have thc in blood for day or week after smoking   when be clearly no longer high   still   law in    state tie drugged driving charge to whether driver have thc   or relate compound   in blood   some state prohibit drive with any amount   and some specify a threshold model after the      limit state use for blood alcohol   but the lag time between be pull over and be transport to a hospital for a blood draw     on average   more than two hour     can lead to false negative   while the tolerance develop by regular user   and the tendency for thc to stick around in bloodstream   can lead to false positive

university political scientist nicholas lovrich     but people be demonstrably able to drive at high level of thc if be a frequent user     the more sensible strategy appear to be prohibit drive while high   and    state take this approach   but prove that a driver be high turn out to be tricky terrain   too   one of the issue that thomas gerhardt raise in lawsuit be whether police officer with standard training be qualified to make a judgment that a driver be high   court in a few state   include new jersey   vermont   and montana   have rule that be not     unlike alcohol intoxication

those who want to gauge own ability to drive after smoking   app have begin to appear that measure thing like reaction time and    coordination     some police department use drug recognition expert

all judge allow dre to testify to finding     be not emt   be not medically train     say lovrich   the washington state university professor   who   in a recent study of five year of dre datum in

a less degree   sen  ted cruz      emerge as the party  s    in the presidential sweepstake   the theory be that both candidate be so polarize that electoral prospect will impale republican candidate down the ballot   let start with the house   the gop currently hold a    edge over democrats   the current vacant seat belong to former house speaker john boehner      and be expect to stay in republican hand   so for the sake of argument   let say      in favor of the gop   democrats would have to flip a staggering net of    seat to reclaim control of the house   wheel out the schadenfreude   democrats would be rapturous at the prospect of     republicans have to defund trump or cruz     or run away from   democrats could probably put a substantial dent in that    republican margin   but that   expect in a presidential election year     just a question of how many more seat a trump or cruz candidacy could turn to democratic control   but make no mistake   knowledgeable source on both side of the aisle be clear that would be almost impossible for democrats to win back the house this cycle   that net gain of    seat be just too high a bar   the map favor republicans     there be not a lot of   swing   district in which democrats could steal a seat or two   nothing be ever out of the question   but the likelihood of democrats nab the house majority be low at this writing   the senate   however   be another story   republicans already face an uphill climb to retain majority this fall   the gop must defend    seat   only    democratic seat be up this cycle   plus     a presidential year   and   many of the republican seat on the ballot be in   purple   state or state that president obama win in      and        for the gop   sens   ron johnson

democrats       so a net gain of five seat be not out of the realm for democrats   many political theorist think those seat in swing state could all tilt to the democratic side if trump or cruz be the

republicans be try to rise above the fray     need to appear like the sane one     say one senior house aide   that   why ryan   push a robust policy agenda and   vision   item this year     there   a

conservative in the house   the agenda   be a key piece of infrastructure that any presidential nominee would need     say   in short   house gopers be hope to   wag the dog   a little   if say trump be the nominee and propound    idea   perhaps congressional republicans can temper that red meat with bona fide policy that represent core value of the party   but that do not stop everyone from freak out on capitol hill   maybe trump and cruz already wag the dog   and then those in congress be the one who look like be out of step with the nominee party select

of hillary clinton  s voter     payne say     but as an independent with a liberal position on virtually every issue at stake in this year  s election   appeal to moderate and conservative voter will be negligible     payne and other also suspect bloomberg float the bid idea be just another way for to stay relevant     late statement could be aim at generate fresh headline and maintain political

circulate from a russian journalist warn american colleague of what to expect under trump   one key paragraph read      let say first the piece be quite good     worth reading   but as a prediction of what await the american press   think be way   way off the mark and the kind of pusillanimous   defeatist attitude have see in this cattle call of trump outrage list above   president do not validate what be and be not news   if be expect to   be do wrong   almost nothing that be truly important about the work of a free press be damage by move the press office across the street     do not get wrong   be not say that these thing be not important or that all these threat be not a very bad sign   be vastly preferable to have a president who believe in or at least respect american and

laugh at   if trump should take some    or    action   will deal with that when happen   doubt will or can   but will not obsess about in advance   journalist should be unbowed and aggressive and with a sense of humor until something happen to prevent from do so   trump be a punk and a bully   people who do not surrender up dignity to unhinge     much the same apply to the endless chatter about   conflict of interest   and the insufficiency of plan to separate from business   why be still say trump be not do enough to avoid conflict of interest     make clear want to profit off presidency

president in american history   only have datum on this go back a few decade   but there   little reason to think any president in previous decade or century have be this unpopular   indeed     get less popular as approach inauguration   people need to have a bit more confidence in   value and country   as soon as realize that the trump want to profit from the presidency and that the republicans be focused and help do so   all the question become easy to answer and the path forward more clear   threat against the press be the same     threaten to take away thing the press do not truly need in

to cover       and who   before the affordable care act   be discriminate against by insurer     be siphon off from the rest of the individual market   to keep premium low for healthy people   the

aca be by no means equivalent to the coverage    condition enrollee have get through obamacare   nor do the state pool account for the million whose coverage would be at a risk with repeal     a    pool be not an appropriate substitute     say linda blumberg   a senior fellow in the health policy center at the urban institute       not an equivalent in anyway for make sure that people with    condition have adequate affordable coverage on an ongoing basis   unless the federal government be willing to invest an enormous amount of dollar into make work     ryan explain on cnn that idea be to allow taxpayer to   finance the coverage for those eight percent of americans under        who have    condition like cancer and other serious ailment   while   dramatically lower the price for the other    percent of americans     but the math be not quite that simple     accord to the department of health and human services   at least    percent of americans have type of condition that would have make eligible for a state high risk pool before the affordable care act   and even more      percent of americans   have more broadly the kind of condition insurer would use as a basis for block coverage   a kaiser analysis estimate that    percent of american adult have the type of condition that would make uninsurable in the individual market before the affordable care act     the hhs and kaiser number above be for the entire population and include people in group plan     but the      pool that exist before the affordable care act cover only a tiny fraction of that population   accord

and    state also impose annual cap on spending   high deductible be also typical   and   nearly all   of the state   program   accord to kaiser   impose a waiting period usually of    month where new enrollee could not get coverage for    condition in order to make   coverage less attractive for people who need coverage specifically for    condition         worth note that if the aca be fully repeal   would clear the way for a return of wait period or exclusion for those with    condition on group plan as well       be not affordable and be not very comprehensive in the way marketplace

message after the news have sink in the next day     trump be sign the law that literally prevent all iranian    from enter state except religious minority     hell     fucking hell     news of the order be first report by reuters earlier in the week   but the full detail be not clear until president trump impose the rule on friday   do through an executive order        not a law        that froze refugee resettlement for     day and then will admit only people from country where cabinet official certify   sufficient safeguard be in place   to vet refugee   also suspend resettle syrian refugee indefinitely   require trump to personally sign off on resume the program   also cut the number of refugee allow to be admit to the us in      to            less than half of the           allow under a cap set by president obama   the new rule make clear that trump could bring an end to the international cooperation that help refugee reach safety   the us be not just one among many country that resettle refugee have a special role because resettle far more refugee to shore than any other country   in        accept      of all refugee resettle worldwide   accord to the un   other country allow much great number of people to remain within border who arrive under own steam   but no country voluntarily resettle more people than the us through the international refugee process   there have long be bipartisan support in the us for refugee relief until republicans begin object to resettle refugee from    part of the middle east under president obama   this backlash help propel trump into the white house   now be shake the foundation of the international system that help people flee war and persecution reach safety     if the us turn back on refugee   then other country may cite this as an excuse to           provide safety to       and come as this system be already stress to breaking point   confront with more people seek shelter than ever before in human history   almost    million people worldwide have flee home as of        accord to the late number publish by the united nations high commissioner for refugees   unhcr     trump  s order also signal a major shakeup in priority for the us refugee program if do resume   under obama   the us make a priority of resettle people who be persecute on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity   the order from trump   however   make a priority of resettle those claim refugee status on the basis of     persecution     this appear to prioritize christians   allow for the continue processing of    refugee claim during the freeze on resettlement only in case where   the religion of that individual be a minority religion in the individual  s country of nationality     in other word   a muslim from iran may not qualify even if claim be relate to faith   the news cause anxiety among refugee throughout turkey   where around   million people be now live after flee homeland   many who speak to buzzfeed news        include some who be in the process to be resettle to the us        appear to be in denial   seem unthinkable to that one man could bring a process to a halt that have be in the work for year under the auspex of the un   many believe trump would only take action against undocumented immigrant     those thing concern the illegal immigrant   not the refugee like     say ana   a lesbian from northwest iran who be force to abandon then     son and flee after brother discover in bed with girlfriend in          all of the refugee who speak to buzzfeed news ask to be identify only by first name or nickname because fear violence for be identify as lgbt or because worry about retaliation from migration official for criticize the process     nienose   a     gay iraqi who come to turkey in      and be now in the final stage of be resettle to the us   say     seem   trump   be do something for which do not know the consequence     nienose now live in sakarya   a city about     mile east of istanbul     the second place   seek shelter in turkey say have to leave manisa   a city near the aegean coast   after turkish neighbor discover picture on instagram reveal be gay   and attempt to kill       maybe trump would think run away because be a terrorist or want to do bad thing in the usa     say nienose     if be here   in turkey   any longer and the usa reject case   believe may kill       whatever may do   however good a person may be        a good citizen        the host still do not like     neil grungras   executive director of oram   an ngo that assist lgbt    say believe threat of suicide be credible   there have already be instance of refugee harm after lose hope during the confusing and bureaucratic process to qualify for resettlement     especially worried about refugee like nienose   who be approach the end of the process and be expect to leave for the us very soon and now have no idea about future     refugee who have just be hang on wait to be resettle           be go to become absolutely despondent        expect people will commit suicide     grungra say   a major slowdown in resettlement to the us could also have much wide consequence   grungra warn   turkey and the eu have be work very hard to try to shut down the sea route to europe that have bring more than   million people into the eu without permission   in march        turkey reach an agreement that allow the eu to deport migrant to turkey   in exchange for cash payment and a commitment to resettle qualified    through legal channel   but this have increase tension over migrant inside turkey   and    refugee need some level of faith in the legitimate asylum process in order not to attempt the increasingly difficult sea crossing   even if someone do not want to go to the us        and most lgbt refugee say prefer canada or europe because fear gun violence   think the us be not    and want easy access to health care        most know another refugee who   go or in the process of go there   these resettlement be proof the process could work if that stop   could cause    to lose faith in the system     turkey be ready to explode   and the refugee program be the pressure release valve        and the us lead the system     grungra say   the system be already burst at the seam   derail the case of even the refugee who have the great reason to believe in a reliable process   two of those in this situation be a couple in    from iran name alireza and saeed   have a comfortable life in the capital   tehran   live together for    year in the building where run a graphic design and printing business   then   around october        saeed  s brother hack saeed  s cell phone and attempt to blackmail with a private sex video   first try to pay a smuggler who promise to get british visa   but skip town with money   then try to get a greek visa   but be reject by the consulate   finally decide need to take the route familiar to many lgbt iranians   most know someone        or at least know about someone        who   go to turkey   claim asylum on the basis of sexual orientation   and be resettle in the west   usually to canada   the whole process usually take two year   and alireza and saeed come to denizli to wait   register with unhcr in march        and learn in april      that have be refer to canada for resettlement   hear nothing else for more than a year   though send hundred of email and call each week try to get an update   finally   alireza say   a unhcr worker call in november to say canada be   close   would not accept case after all   instead   case would be forward to the us   where trump have just be elect president   trump do not worry   say in an interview on monday just before news of planned refugee order break     know trump be the new president but that do not do anything to     alireza say     be legal immigrant        that do not concern     saeed add   be shock when learn of the report on wednesday     have be wait so long the only hope that if canada be closed   there be us   what can do     say alireza     feel like unwanted guest     say saeed     whatever may do   however good a person may be        a good citizen        the host still do not like     alireza and saeed be not the only one in this situation   saghi ghahraman   director of the iranian queer organization   a    group that support    in turkey with the resettlement process   say have receive more than    report from people whose case be pende with canada who be inform case would be refer to the us instead   with trump in office   ghahraman warn     think be trap there in turkey     neither unhcr nor canada  s immigration agency respond to question about these case   but migration expert say the global scramble to find spot for the overwhelming population of syrian refugee have mean be become harder for    to be resettle     would not be surprised if syrians be crowd out iranians in      as the government be clearly prioritize syrians over everyone     say howard anglin   who be chief of staff to canada  s immigration minister before justin trudeau be elect prime minister in        lgbt syrians have actually have a relatively quick path to safety in recent month   many country have give priority to resettle syrians in response to public outcry as refugee of a war that   estimate to have claim the life of more than           people and displace almost   million have reach european shore   and unhcr consider lgbt syrian refugee at particular risk of violence in turkey   especially after a     name wisam sankari be find decapitate in istanbul in july   since then   oram say have be able to help client face threat of violence access a small number of spot unhcr reserve for   emergency   resettlement that can get out of the country in less than a year   while the process for people who be not deem high risk can take many year   most of these    case go to european country   because the us  s extensive legal and security review be generally consider too slow for urgent situation   the us already maintain some of the most extensive vetting procedure of any resettle country   but even the european country that resettle the large number of refugee take far few than the us   which resettle          refugee from country around the world in        accord to figure from the international organization for migration   the uk   which resettle the most refugee of any european nation that year   take just           and many european country stop accept new case in        accord to oram   while there be            lgbt refugee in turkey register for resettlement   the    scenario for those await resettlement under the trump order be that the us fully resume resettlement program after the    freeze   but even then   there will be          few slot to the united states at a time when million of people be hope to be resettle from conflict area around the world   canada   which resettle          refugee in      make second to the united states in the number of refugee resettle   be already refuse new case from turkey in late        australia be the recipient of the    group of refugee in        take            the country  s internal politic make unlikely for to increase resettlement to pick up the hole leave by the us   the issue of resettlement be highly controversial there as well   and the country be lock in a    battle over a couple thousand    who be confine to remote pacific island after attempt to reach the country by boat   a us retreat on refugee commitment could have a domino effect   worry beg m ba da    who work on asylum issue for amnesty international turkey     if the us turn back on refugee   then other country may cite this as an excuse to shirk obligation under international law to provide safety to   ba da  say   and if    lose hope in get to safety through the official resettlement process   believe more will risk life by cross the sea in smuggler   boat     if these   international   commitment   to shelter refugee   fail   the refugee who need a well life will do whatever take to reach area where think will be safe and a future for child     say     people will die        that   what mean in plain english         this story have be update follow president trump sign the executive order on

be write   among the most important issue to consider be the obama administration  s record on religious liberty   as will argue base on episode throughout president obama  s time in office   this administration oversee an unprecedented effort to intentionally malign and dethrone religious liberty as a central pillar in american political and civil life   notwithstanding this overall record   and though neither of be a political supporter of obama   applaud the effort make by the administration in a few area to champion religious liberty   in        obama be a u  s  senator and presidential candidate publicly oppose to    marriage   much have change in eight year   for the foreseeable future   the legacy of the obama administration will rest on two alliterative   colossal initiative that have leave an indelible crater on the landscape of religious liberty   obamacare and obergefell v  hodges   the decision in obergefell v  hodges   which establish that    couple possess a constitutional right to marry   be the product of the supreme court   but the june      ruling could not have be achieve apart from the considerable effort of the obama administration   in february        more than four year before obergefell   obama instruct attorney general eric holder to cease all effort to defend section   of the defense of marriage act   doma     that legislation be sign into law in      by president bill clinton and establish two thing   as state begin to settle the question of    marriage   section   of doma guarantee that no state could be compel to recognize a    relationship that be   treat as marriage   in another state   similarly   section   define marriage   for federal purpose   as   only the legal union of one man and one woman as husband and wife     a full year before publicly declare support for    marriage   obama determine that section   of doma be unconstitutional and under direction   the department of justice refuse to defend the law from challenge   but do not stop there   in        the administration file a legal brief in opposition to doma in united states v  windsor   in a         decision   the supreme court hold that doma  s definition of marriage violate the due    clause of the fifth amendment and be therefore unconstitutional   follow the same line of argument present in the amicus curiae brief from solicitor general donald verrilli   the administration  s chief advocate before the court   aware that windsor clear the path for    marriage nationwide   president obama hail the ruling as a victory for equality and a blow to discrimination   the implication be   of course   that a belief contrary to the supreme court  s decision must be base in animus toward gay people     as justice antonin scalia remark in dissent opinion   the ruling of the majority essentially declare   anyone oppose to    marriage an enemy of human decency     the administration  s decision to abandon doma signal the perilous future for religious freedom in america   obama sign the affordable care act   subsequently dub   obamacare     into law in march        during the implementation of the law   the department of health and human services   hhs   issue a mandate in january      require most employer health plan to provide   all    form of contraception   include some that act as abortifacient   despite be aware of the conscience issue create by such a rule   the hhs mandate allow only the narrow of exemption for certain type of religious employer   the protest of business owner   religious leader of various faith   and advocate of freedom fall on deaf ear   the administration  s unyielding commitment to this hhs mandate reveal animus toward religious freedom and ultimately result in two very consequential and public defeat for the president  s agenda   in burwell v  hobby lobby   the supreme court issue a         ruling against the administration  s attempt to coerce    business to provide abortifacient as a part of employer health plan   in an important   if troublingly narrow   victory for religious liberty   the court determine in a troublingly narrow decision   on the basis of the federal religious freedom restoration act   rfra   that the mandate place an undue burden on the plaintiff  s religious freedom   this verdict could have be avoid but for the administration  s intolerance and obstinacy   even after this ruling   in a demonstration of further hostility   the administration steadfastly refuse to grant exception to the hhs mandate for moral or religious reason   in may        the administration be deal a serious blow when the supreme court vacate the court of appeals rule in zubik v  burwell   which consolidate six separate case challenge the mandate   the court send the decision of those six case back to respective court and order reconsideration   among those seek relief from the oppressive mandate be the little sisters of the poor   a roman catholic religious order dedicate to care for the elderly poor   after year of bureaucratic and legal strife        to say nothing of the threat of    fine for conscientious dissent        the administration ultimately acknowledge that this mandate be not the least restrictive mean of further a government interest in provide contraceptive   again   an unnecessary outcome   from the start   the administration should have establish compromise measure to ensure health coverage for contraceptive without needlessly burden religious exercise   but such intransigence only prove the large point   for the obama administration   whatever the value of religious freedom may be   could easily be subjugate to a high   more progressive   ideal   while the hhs mandate controversy be an intricate policy matter   be an alarming bellwether of the administration  s approach to freedom of conscience   the obama administration  s strident support for the mandate and tight grip on the matter demonstrate how ingrained both contraception and abortion be within progressive orthodoxy        over and against claim of conscience back by sound philosophical reasoning   this opposition to conscience on abortion be again on display when the white house come out against the conscience protection act   a law design to prevent the government from take any adverse action against    provider who do not want to participate in abortion   obergefell   to say that legacy be tie to obergefell be simply to acknowledge president obama  s own claim in farewell address   to be clear   support    marriage do not necessarily mean oppose religious liberty   but after obama  s   evolution   on    marriage   the administration take great pain to advance the sexual revolution even at the expense of religious freedom   go so far as to submit an amicus brief in obergefell to cement support for    marriage   because religious liberty and gay right be often frame as a    game   the administration  s support for obergefell signal lack of concern for religious liberty   perhaps the most damn piece of evidence display the administration  s callous attitude toward religious freedom and right of conscience appear in the obergefell oral argument   as justice alito question solicitor general verrilli about the potential consequence for institution oppose to    marriage   the solicitor general reply       certainly go to be an issue   do not deny that   do not deny that   justice alito   be    be go to be an issue     this response do not represent an uncertain answer to an unanticipated question   the administration know that the obergefell ruling would cause conflict between religious liberty and gay right        manifest most prominently today in the legal battle between lgbt individual and commercial actor such as baker and florist      and high educational institution with traditional view of marriage        but such conflict be of little concern to   the administration be content to depict any religious institution or person hold fast to traditional belief on marriage as engage in invidious form of discrimination   as a foreboding signal of the problem to arise   each of the dissent justice in obergefell specifically highlight the way in which the ruling represent an enormous threat to religious liberty   and in the month follow the court  s ruling   the administration make clear that there would be no compromise   to credit   president obama have say that there be people of   goodwill   on both side of the marriage debate   and personally have never demean religious traditionalist   in interview with robin roberts   express newfound   evolution   on marriage   the president even make a bold overture to those who disagree with    marriage   think   important to recognize that folk who feel very strongly that marriage should be define narrowly as between a man and a woman   many of be not come at from a    perspective   be come at because care about family   and have a different understanding   in term of what the word   marriage   should mean   and a bunch of be friend of mine   pastor and people who deeply respect   but despite obama  s call for tolerance and understanding toward citizen whose sincerely hold belief prevent from embrace    marriage   the administration attempt to obstruct nearly every defense of conscience right on this issue   with the wind at back and place on the   right side of history   solidify   the obama administration opportunistically exploit debate over marriage and sexuality for the sake of political gamesmanship   for example   when in april      indiana adopt a    rfra   the administration call an attempt to   legalize discrimination     and when mississippi   tennessee   and georgia attempt to pass similar legislation   press secretary josh earnest call those bill    effort to target and marginalize sexual minority   despite the fact that as a state senator   obama have vote for a similar measure in illinois   sexual orientation and gender identity   today  s conflict over religious freedom be find at the intersection of religious liberty and effort to expand    law to include sexual orientation and gender identity   sogi     progressive have find an ally in these effort than the obama administration   and indeed   in every instance of sogi conflict   the obama administration side with those who wish to stigmatize religious conservative   assault the identity of religious institution   and drive traditionalist to the margin of the public square or out of entirely   while continue to pay lip service to religious liberty as an ideal   the administration repeatedly demonstrate willingness to sacrifice in favor of sexual progressivism   this willingness be evident in the administration  s strong support for the equality act   legislation that would strip away the conscience protection establish by the federal rfra   in addition   the administration  s animus be clear in support for the employment    act   enda   disregard for the    right of federal contractor   and rejection of the russell amendment   which would preserve religious liberty in federal contract   in these way   the administration have use every available mechanism to advance sogi protection   to comprehend the breadth of these concern   consider the department of education   sweeping and deeply offensive attempt to force all public school to adopt controversial transgend policy relate to gender identity   leave to the obama administration   male who profess a gender identity at odd with biological sex would be grant access to female restroom and vice versa   not only be this effort base on specious interpretation of title ix   but include gender identity under the provision  s prohibition on sex discrimination   the move be rightfully meet with immense protest as violate student privacy   undermine parental authority   and treat with hostility the religious conviction that gender be base on biological sex   rather than internal     international religious freedom   the obama administration aid and abet the undoing of domestic religious liberty to be sure   but internationally   make positive contribution to religious freedom   in        president obama nominate david n  saperstein to be     for international religious freedom   this be a welcome shift   consider the administration  s prior lack of attention to international religious freedom   evident in the fact that the office of the ambassador be vacant more often than be occupy prior to saperstein  s appointment   since confirmation saperstein   a fierce    advocate   have lead the office of international religious freedom at the state department and fight tirelessly to counter religious persecution across the globe   additionally   should be note and applaud that in the final week of administration   obama sign the frank r  wolf international religious freedom act into law   a critical step toward elevate religious freedom in america  s foreign policy that commit the federal government to make this issue a significant consideration in foreign engagement      and domestic efforts   notwithstanding these laudable contribution to international religious freedom   the    case put to rest any doubt about the obama administration  s effort to weaken the place of religious liberty in american life   in        the supreme court issue a unanimous ruling affirming that both the free exercise clause and the establishment clause of the constitution bar the government from contradict   a church  s determination of who can act as minister     not only do the administration oppose the decision        a ruling that be a tremendous victory for religious liberty        but demonstrate remarkable hubris in do so   as ed whelan note at nro   the justice department  s opposition to    threaten   to expose church and other religious institution to a broad array of    claim that the    have long shield from     in other word   the administration argue that the government should oversee the selection of religious minister   such aggression be a complete departure from    precedent that consider religious body to be     materially different from    but still significant   the obama administration do side correctly on one important issue relate to the    debate   in the town of greece   new york v  susan galloway case   the administration issue an amicus brief in support of the right of municipality to open meeting with prayer   this be an important display of respect for the nation  s historic interaction with public display of religion   similarly   the obama administration defend the constitutionality of the national day of prayer when a federal court rule otherwise   the administration also protect religious minority from workplace discrimination   side with a muslim woman before the supreme court who be fire for wear religious attire   and eventually prevail   religious conservative be often portray as angry aggressor in the culture war   nothing could be furth from the truth   as evident in the case of the obama administration  s progressive assault upon religious liberty   the obama administration determine religious freedom to be a worthy sacrifice on the altar of progressivism   the problem be not that this liberty have cease to exist nor that liberal see no value in   but rather that religious liberty have become a cudgel with which to score political point   once a cherished and bipartisan american value prize in constitution   be now a weapon use in a culture war     license to discriminate       war on woman        these be talk point   design to denude religious liberty   which find warm reception in the age of obama   as writer who caution against hyperbole   can not help but conclude that the obama administration be immensely hostile to religious liberty when judge against history and previous administration   yes   the obama administration pay lip service to religious liberty through proclamation and the obligatory overture one expect from a president   but the protection traditionally afford by religious freedom be severely weaken under the president  s stewardship   whatever one will make of obama  s legacy   history will support the conclusion that administration work to delegitimize the belief of million of americans of diverse faith and remove from within the bound of acceptable discourse   there be many reason to applaud president obama     decorum   admirable role

",over the last eight year   more than two dozen state attorney general have muster a veritable legal army to thwart the unconstitutional overreach of the obama presidency   with the change in administration   however   these elite force should not disband   but rather must retool   if the trump white house be to succeed in restore constitutional governance   will need the support   cooperation   and sometimes pressure from the state   in the short term   state attorney general can coordinate with the incoming justice department to identify the case and appeal that should be dismiss or settle   further   these legal officer should roadmap how congress and the president can rescind unlawful executive action   go forward   when progressive state seek to resist federal incursion   conservative state should consider support the principle underlie those case   state capitol   not the central government   should decide local matter   precedent set during this period will   in the long run   entrench the separation of power   and ultimately promote individual liberty   roll back regulations   over the next six month   congressional republicans have a unique opportunity to rescind regulation that be publish in the waning day of the obama administration   the congressional review act   cra   pass in      as part of the contract with america   allow congress to disapprove of a regulation that be less than    legislative day old   if the president agree   the regulation be rescind   and the agency be permanently prohibit from regulate on that issue ever again   salt the earth in the code of federal regulations   the cra have be use only once        by president george w  bush in      to rescind an inconsequential regulation concern ergonomic in the workplace   now   republicans have a unique opportunity to kill a bevy of rule that be finalize follow may             count backwards    legislative day from the end of the previous session     for those unlawful regulation that can not be kill by the cra        either due to a lack of floor time or a lack of congressional will        there be still hope      agency can initiate new rulemaking   where announce that upon further reflection   have determine that old regulation be contrary to law   and can no longer stand   to assist this process   state attorney general should thumb through the federal register over the past eight year   flag all arbitrary and capricious regulation   and draft propose rule to wipe out the    regime   this support can help relieve the burden from overwork    agency that will likely find little support from the entrenched bureaucracy   indeed   civil servant may even oppose and resist the incoming administration  s agenda through    leak to the medium   or    disobedience   finally   not that need   but the state can give direction to president trump as use pen and phone   sharpie and twitter     to systematically unravel president obama  s unlawful executive action   litigate for the cause of federalism   beyond the regulatory process   republican attorney general should continue to use elite legal team to litigate for the cause of federalism        even if incidentally help progressive state   for example   california have recently boast that seek to become the new texas        like orange be the new black        and rely on the principle of federalism to resist incursion from the trump administration into sanctuary city   while conservative may oppose sanctuary city as a matter of policy   federalist should never lose sight of the fact that the state        and not the central government        should have control over local    matter     consider the controversy over effort by the justice department to monitor police department     indeed   legislator in austin be currently debate a bill to defund texas municipality that refuse to assist with federal immigration enforcement   that be the right way to handle this sort of issue   when california challenge the trump administration in court   conservative state should not sit by idly   there be a unique opportunity to advance the cause of federalism   and in the process   benefit from any precedent set by    federalist on the supreme court   first   california will likely assert that be unconstitutional for the trump administration to withhold federal fund from sanctuary city   once   and only once   have the supreme court hold that claw back federal funding violate the principle of federalism   under the affordable care act   aca   if a state refuse to expand medicaid roll   the federal government threaten to withhold all of medicaid funding   for example   the obama administration warn arizona that stand to lose nearly     billion of federal funding   which be nearly a quarter of state budget   the court observe that across the board     medicaid spending account for over    percent of the average state  s total budget   with federal fund cover    to    percent of those cost     in other word   state stand to lose on average    percent of budget for fail to comply with obamacare   the aca  s   financial   inducement       explain chief justice roberts     be much more than   relatively mild encouragement          be a gun to the head     because   pressure turn into compulsion     the court conclude that the aca  s medicaid expansion be unconstitutional   this precedent   however   do not mean that every effort to withhold money from noncompliant state be unconstitutional   congress routinely dangle aid to encourage state to comply with federal program   for example   south dakota challenge a law that would withhold   percent of otherwise available federal highway fund if the state refuse to raise drinking age to      in        the supreme court uphold this law   find that   congress have offer relatively mild encouragement to the states to enact high minimum drinking age than would otherwise choose     however   the amount at issue be miniscule   in nfib v  sebelius   the court point out that   the federal fund at stake     roughly     million     constitute less than half of one percent of south dakota  s budget at the time     if sanctuary city seek to halt president trump  s withdrawal of funding   and the amount fall somewhere between       percent and    percent   the supreme court will have to make new precedent   will not be sufficient to rely solely on nfib v  sebelius   in that case   chief justice roberts admit that there be   no need to fix a line   between   persuasion   and   coercion     yet   to rule against trump   justices ginsburg and sotomayor   who dissent in nfib   will have to go along with a new rule that withhold an amount of money less than that at issue in the obamacare case be now coercive   conservative state   rather than wait on the sideline   should gladly point out to the court this necessary departure from nfib   and more specifically   can flag all of the other federal program   which threaten to withhold comparably small amount   be now at risk of invalidation in subsequent litigation   in the long run   a unanimous decision that put more tooth into the    jurisprudence inure to the benefit of red state   attorney general in flyover country should gladly hoist these coastal    federalist on own petard   second   california may assert that congress do not provide adequate notice before change the criterion for receipt of federal fund   the supreme court have hold that   if congress intend to impose a condition on the grant of federal money   must do so unambiguously     the federal government can not   surpris e   participate state with postacceptance or   retroactive   condition     like the state oppose obamacare  s medicaid expansion   california could assert that be   surprise ed     by the trump administration  s imposition of     retroactive   condition     which   transform ed     the policy   so dramatically     once again   conservative state should support this fight   and urge the supreme court to reaffirm the      rule   such a precedent would provide an important precedent for attorney general to challenge    agency that suddenly   and unexpectedly   impose massive new condition on the state   without any adequate notice   by point out the implication of rule for    federalist   conservative attorney general can establish another important check on federal power   to use a contemporary example   the department of education recently reinterpret title ix   a     law that prohibit sex discrimination in educational institution   to require all public school to allow student to use bathroom base on gender identity   this term the supreme court will consider the validity of this new policy   if be not first withdraw by the trump administration     west virginia   join by    other state   file a brief urge the supreme court to reject the agency   rewrite of federal law   which impose transformative condition on the state   if the supreme court would be willing to strike down the trump administration  s change with respect to immigration funding   then the obama administration  s dramatic change to title ix can not stand   third   california may resist any effort to cooperate with federal immigration official        and perhaps could even impede work   for example   several city already refuse to transfer to the federal government certain criminal alien who be not lawfully present        ignoring    detainer        unless a federal court order the release   here   progressive be rally behind justice scalia  s opinion in united states v  printz   which hold that congress can not commandeer state official to perform firearm background check     ironically   a gaggle of blue state file a brief in printz support the constitutionality of the clinton administration  s conscriptive    law     but there be another precedent for california to contend with   arizona  s s  b         commonly refer to as the   show paper   law   give local law enforcement the power to arrest alien who be in violation of federal immigration law   the supreme court invalidate this provision of s  b         find that   stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purpose and objective of congress     federal control over immigration   the court hold   be   so pervasive       that congress leave no room for the states to supplement     in other word   state immigration policy that interfere with the comprehensive federal immigration scheme be preempt   if arizona be not allow to adopt a policy that arguably help federal law enforcement   by arrest those subject to removal   then california certainly can not adopt a policy that explicitly impede federal law enforcement   this precedent do not help sanctuary city     for more irony   california file a brief support the obama administration   and oppose arizona     there be a tension   however   between these two case   under printz   local official can not be conscript to enforce federal    duty   at the same time   a state law or policy that serve as an   obstacle   to congress  s federal immigration scheme violate the holding of arizona   conservative attorney general should cheerfully point out this tension to the court   for california to prevail   the supreme court will have to shake thing up   printz  s commandeering doctrine will be expand   thus reign in the power of the central government arizona  s preemption analysis will be curtail   which expand a state  s internal police power   this rejiggering of precedent would be a boon to federalism   fourth   california may attempt to sue the trump administration   for failure to enforce various law   if that paradigm sound familiar should   texas challenge the legality of the obama administration  s    of the immigration law   know as dapa   this suit   however   be not unprecedented   in        massachusetts   join by california   sue the environmental protection agency for fail to regulate greenhouse gas   the supreme court hold that because the massachusetts coastline could be erode by the effect of climate change   the state be sufficiently injure to sue in federal court   cite the basis of massachusetts v  epa   the low court hold that texas have stand to challenge dapa     the supreme court ultimately deadlocke on this issue       while california support president obama  s illegal executive action on immigration   file a brief in support of dapa   may not be so keen when the trump administration decide to exercise discretion with respect to environmental   financial   and other regulatory prosecution   if progressive state attempt to challenge executive    of the law        beyond the context of climate change        conservative state should consider support the principle that court can enforce the president  s duty to faithfully execute the law   should point out that be not sufficient to merely reply on massachusetts   but will need to make new precedent        a precedent that could one day prevent a future a wholesale suspension of the immigration law   fifth   blue state will likely adopt a powerful tool use by red state to reign in federal policy   the nationwide injunction   over the past three year   federal district judge   mostly in texas   have    halt president obama  s unlawful policy concern immigration   labor law   and financial regulation   use these injunction   the judge have bind    official in all    state        even those that welcome the executive policy   for example   california urge judge andrew hanen in brownsville that president obama  s immigration order should be allow to go into effect in state that want   no dice   the court hold   soon enough   these dynamic will flip   as federal judge in san francisco   brooklyn   and chicago   be confront with request for nationwide injunction to halt the trump administration   as the progressive reverse course   republican attorney general should maintain consistency   more often than not   federal official will overreach   rather than underreach   the nationwide injunction be one of the only remedy available to quickly halt illegal action before take effect        and become entrenched   so long as the president take executive action   especially outside the formal     process of rulemaking   court should be able to quickly put a hold on violation of law   this be a policy that attorney general of all stripe should unwaveringly support   why federalism matters   be not pollyannaish   be easy enough for a law professor to extoll the value of federalism   but on the ground   elect attorney general may face a backlash if actively challenge the trump administration in court   three important value should guide this important decision   first   donald trump will only be president for the next four to eight year   sooner   rather than later   a progressive will be in the white house   the precedent that be establish now will serve as a check on the havoc a president elizabeth warren could unleash on the state   second   there be a powerful value to gain    from the liberal justice        especially those who will serve for decade to come        for the principle of federalism   true   justices kagan or sotomayor may be able to distinguish california  s present challenge with texas  s future challenge        but the feebleness of those    will be visible to all   finally   and most importantly   state official take an oath to the constitution   not to the republican party   bear the unique responsibility for enforce the tenth amendment   in all of dimension     the power not delegate to the united states by the constitution   nor prohibit by to the state   be reserve to the state respectively   or to the people     the mission of reining in the federal government  s power   and restore the constitution  s separation of power   should continue for the next four year   eight year   and beyond

be well than a bad deal     if this strategy propose a hard road than business want   at least initially   be also the only road that lead to the recovery of the    democracy that the brits vote for when vote to leave the eu   all the talk of   hard   and   soft   brexit have obscure   as those who coin the term perhaps intend   exactly what leave the eu entail   to grasp that   consider what the

that measure of public opinion may say as much about grow polarization over the last few decade as about obama  s performance   the most important difference in political record be that reagan be follow in office by an ally while obama will not be   george h  w  bush run for reagan  s third term in      and win a decisive victory   in this way show that reaganism  s electoral success be not dependent on the surpass political talent of reagan   if have win   perhaps hillary clinton would have show that the political trend line obama have identify could carry even someone who lack a trace of charisma to victory   but do not win   the democratic strategy of the obama year have leave the party lock out of power in the white house   the senate   and the house at end   a heavily urban and progressive coalition deliver presidential majority twice   but geography put the party at a structural disadvantage in senate   house   and gubernatorial race   and the democrats may have push strategy too far even at the presidential level   if clinton have replicate obama  s      performance among white catholics or white evangelical or white    voter   would have win the election   but campaign be not gear to the sensibility of any of these overlap group   at no point in obama  s presidency do political success make republicans consider assimilate some of view into philosophy   as

at richards   give chance after chance to defend the abortion group   and often step in to bolster case   this   interview   of sort be an excellent example of how progressive be able to control the cultural dialogue so easily   celebrity   comedian   and much of the news medium be only too willing to provide ostensibly unbiased cover for the institution and issue that liberal care about   democratic activist and politician be treat with kid glove on show watch by million of americans   in this case allow richards to wield carefully word messaging to persuade viewer to trust a group as crooked as planned parenthood   although most of point be incorrect or deceptive and can easily be debunk with some basic fact     be really proud at planned parenthood to provide woman all reproductive health care   and always will     richards say   and later     this be an issue of access to health care   of a wide swath of health care   and for many folk   be only health care   paul ryan be say     be go to end that       an accurate assessment of the group  s abortion number reveal that one in eight woman who visit a planned parenthood clinic obtain an abortion   to obscure that fact   planned parenthood consistently overstate other   supposedly crucial service   falsely claim to provide mammogram and exaggerate commitment to prenatal care   in fact   the group provide less than   percent of the nation  s pap test and less than   percent of breast exam and cancer screening   while at the same time provide over    percent of abortion   although thousand of federally qualified    center   fqhcs   across the country be able to provide woman with numerous necessary service        many of more essential than those offer by planned parenthood        richards maintain that fqhc can not handle the volume of patient currently serve by planned parenthood and that woman therefore will still lose    access if the organization be defunde   this be difficult to believe   give the          fqhc and rural    clinic across the country   whereas planned parenthood operate a mere     facility     see this excellent map to understand how drastically community clinic outnumber planned parenthoods   by a ratio of    to one     planned parenthood executive contend that    woman in rural area in particular will be harm if the abortion group be defunde   but take   for example   the rural state of nebraska   which have a total of two planned parenthood clinic and     fqhc   how could be possible that two planned parenthood clinic serve so many woman that     healthcare center would be overwhelm by an overflow of patient   meanwhile   even in california   the state with the most planned parenthood clinic by far   the abortion group have a mere     center compare with         community health clinic   in addition   richards assert that the republican party do not care about woman and that in try to remove government funding from planned parenthood republicans be play partisan politic with woman  s health care   but if anyone be make a political game out of woman  s care   be planned parenthood and democratic ally   who demand that the government subsidize health care that the group have bundle together with highly controversial        not to mention immoral        abortion procedure   if planned parenthood stop perform abortion   few in either party would object to fund the organization republicans at every level support reimburse fqhc to provide necessary care that do not include abortion   if the group see as invaluable to american woman   should cease provide abortion and focus all of resource on truly essential health care   but will never do that   because be first and foremost an abortion corporation   that be where the bulk of profit come from   finally   richards repeatedly claim that the american people love planned parenthood and do not want to be defunde   brag about the outpouring of support the group have see since the election   perhaps miss the late poll on the defunding effort   which show that voter in      senate battleground state        florida   missouri   montana   north dakota   ohio   and wisconsin        support end federal funding for planned parenthood      to    percent    percent strongly support federal funding for planned parenthood   while    percent strongly oppose   even more interesting   the poll find that   by a margin of over    percentage point   americans in these battleground state would be less likely to vote for any senator who vote to give federal money to planned parenthood rather than to local community health center    percent consider   much less likely   to do so   much of that distaste with planned parenthood surely come from status as the country  s large abortion organization   especially as the popularity of abortion have decline dramatically over time a november poll find that just under    of americans support legislation prohibit abortion after the   th week of pregnancy   include almost    percent of millennial   meanwhile   a marist poll from last summer show that    percent of americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion   include    percent of    americans and    percent of democrats   and though the hyde amendment technically prohibit taxpayer money from be use for abortion   the fungibility of money be such that the       million in government funding to planned parenthood function as a cushion on top of which can continue to conduct bloody business     in a shocking display of honesty   richards say     wrong   that federal money can not be use to pay for abortion directly        which   thank to the hyde amendment   can not     if this interview be richards  s good attempt at be honest with the american people

before the result be know   should put to rest the question of whether james comey or vladimir putin tip the scale against secretary clinton   the answer be no   and that conclusion be not speculation     base solely on datum   most important   independent put these issue at the bottom of ranking   and this be where the medium make another major miscalculation that continue today   for voter in the political center   the media  s fascination with what amount to the   clash du jour   be white noise        in the background but not central to how would choose the next president   voter rank comey  s action   th in importance   and the allegation of trump  s tie to russia come in dead last at   th   will leave the   who do what when   of both comey and putin to the official investigator   that be not the question under discussion here   what analysis look at be what actually motivate voter        especially those who decide in the final week        to elect trump over clinton   the exit poll and survey find a different explanation than the one the medium be drive today   the economy and job issue drive the election   be not outside political force   foreign or domestic nor be comey or putin   that unknown context        when and how these voter would make choice        add significant volatility to the race   as a result   the election model   which be drive medium narrative   prove unreliable   the political expert and pundit take poll and predictive model at face value because almost entirely miss the volatility that be churn below the poll   surface number   especially in the critical rust belt state   on election day   much to the surprise of the political elite   trump win the election   in large part because these unhappy voter who dislike both candidate break way by    point nationally   in the rust belt states of michigan   ohio   pennsylvania   and wisconsin   the trend be even more pronounced   trump  s margin with these voter range from    point in michigan to    point in wisconsin   win majority in all four key state   the    view of the race also lead democrats and the medium to overestimate the state of play that exist in september and to underestimate the potential impact of the volatility in october and november   while    percent of voter make up mind before october   with clinton lead by six percentage point at the time   the exit poll show that those who decide in october break for trump    percent to    percent   in the last week   trump  s lead slip   but still win late decider             in the rust belt state   voter who decide the last week break even more significantly for trump   the number show that this late shift be enough to change the outcome of michigan   where be tie   and wisconsin   where be down two point go into the last week   despite clinton  s lead in national poll up to the last weekend   the traditional democratic coalition in michigan   ohio   pennsylvania   and wisconsin be in trouble as frustrated voter   who feel leave behind economically   struggle with choice   so what drive undecided voter   especially those with negative view of both candidate   to choose trump   ultimately   for    percent of the electorate   a significant number   come down to which candidate believe would bring real change   of those who decide in the last month   that number increase to    percent   this be particularly true in the rust belt state   where the percentage of    decider who rate   change   as top issue range from    percent in michigan to    percent in wisconsin   overall   trump win these change voter by an astonishing           margin nationally   and reach    percent in the rust belt   what be behind this desire for change   as have be for the last four election   job and the economy be the top issue in both the exit poll and in the winning the issue survey   in the    survey   voter break down this way in rank order   republicans         foreign    independents who decide the election         get thing do in d  c  democrats     make the wealthy pay fair share       nowhere be this more apparent than in the rust belt state with three key demographic group that historically have be part of the democrats   coalition   union member   people earn less than              and people with less than a college education   two example   first   in wisconsin   among union household   president obama beat romney by    percent   in this election   clinton win over trump by only    percent   second   in pennsylvania   among those make under less than            a year   president obama beat romney by    percent   in this election   clinton beat trump by only    percent   in those state   exit poll show that           percent of voter choose the economy as top issue   one key voter group        those who say the economy be   not so good          be another prime example of the shift see from      to        president obama win this group by    percent over

percent in pennsylvania to    percent in ohio   overall   these result generate an outcome not see since reagan  s win in        a republican presidential candidate carry michigan   ohio   pennsylvania   and wisconsin   the bottom line be that people be unhappy with the direction of the country   want someone to rock the boat   trump promise a different future focus on the economy and

history at oxford   in essay   what   in a name     write that the good way to discover shakespeare  s political belief be to examine the underlie assumption take for grant by all of character   what find be the philosophical outlook of an aristocrat pervade with longing for the past and gloom about the future   precisely because shakespeare  s arrival as an artist coincide with the end of the renaissance   in    s analysis   shakespeare the dramatist support the feudal social order   detest the puritans   hate rebellion in all form   and tend to ignore god in the canon because be a

 as polonius in hamlet   without suffer consequence   there be no record of william shakespeare   be bring in for question even after the crown arrest member of the lord chamberlain  s men   the

horror when the obama administration toy with the idea of lease out nearly     m acre of the atlantic   stretch from maryland to georgia   only to reverse course in the face of the public uproar and concern from the pentagon over potential disturbance to military operation   trump   who have promise to   unleash american energy   have already reopen the door to coalmine on federal land and push

cahoon   an oceanographer at the university of north carolina   recall the panic that the      bp deepwater horizon spill would result in oil seep around florida and up the    coast       have people cancel vacation reservation in north carolina because see a video on the news that show the oil reach that far     say     of course that never actually happen   the wind be all wrong   but put people in a panic   so if actually have a spill off this coast   would be catastrophic for the economy here     have benefit from the misfortune in other state because people think beach be pristine   which be   that would be severely damage by any spill     the current federal offshore drilling plan rule out any drilling within    mile of the coast   despite the lobbying of some state to allow activity closer to shore   cahoon say if the trump administration relax the    limit would be a   virtual certainty   that oil from a spill would stain north carolina  s beach     if blow past that limit   there will be a firestorm of opposition     say     if people start see oil rig from the beach there will be severe blowback     the potential consequence for wildlife could be severe   north carolina

use by these animal   scientist say   the obama administration deny all seismic airgun permit along the atlantic but this situation   too   may change under the new presidency   any new drilling be unlikely in the short term   at least   revise the bureau of ocean energy management  s    plan would involve a lengthy   bitterly oppose process   and even if lease be make available in the atlantic   any permit for drilling would require a separate environmental study before any approval be grant   the economic of open up a new frontier for oil be currently unfavorable   with a barrel of crude currently trade for under        the strong current and crash wave of the atlantic provide a further logistical hurdle     compare to the atlantic   the gulf of mexico be a lake     say cahoon     yes   can engineer way around that but the question would be   be worth       however   the petroleum industry would still like the option to drill   market condition could become more favorable over the

erik milito   policy director at the american petroleum institute   tell bloomberg news       be important to keep option open for the long term   so company can start plan for and determine where the

as if make up for lose momentum a full midweek programme follow this come weekend  s fixture and by the time everyone have play twice in four or five day the remain game will be down to single figure and the    will be under way   chelsea  s    lead mean be universally regard as a    for the title   though by that reckon arsenal have no chance of overhaul tottenham   who be nine point ahead of london rival   while arsenal have a game in hand   also have a testing match come up with the visit of manchester city   pep guardiola  s side be probably not the ideal opponent to face when have lose four of last five league game          a unique bad patch where have not be for    year   be how ars ne wenger describe        and though be unlikely city will base strategy on outjumpe arsenal at corner this could be another day of reckoning and recrimination at the emirates   be just as well the sky above the stadium be    to stunt plane   otherwise the next logical progression may be an aerial dogfight between the oppose faction   arsenal lose in manchester in december and should do so again a    gap would open up between   be worth note that wenger  s team have by far the bad record among    club of take point from other side in that echelon   liverpool be the top performer in the    at the top of the table with an average return of       point per game against the lead seven club   chelsea be not far behind with         while the gunners bring up the rear with a paltry         city  s own stat be not that impressive   along with manchester united average a point per game against    opponent   but arsenal  s wobble against top side begin on the first day of the season with a    home defeat by liverpool and have not really recover since   unless this be to be the first season this century without champions league football at arsenal be vital city be not allow to extend lead into double figure   even if realistically be liverpool who arsenal and united be look to overtake   saturday bring the merseyside derby at anfield and should liverpool take three point from neighbour        always a possibility bear in mind win the early encounter at goodison          too   will be nine point ahead of arsenal by    time against city   crucially   however   liverpool will have play three game more   while j rgen klopp  s side have a good record against lead club this season and do not have to play any more of once everton be out of the way   what appear a straightforward    be complicate by the knowledge that team from the bottom half of the table have tend to be the one capable of trip liverpool up   with five club vie for the three champions league place below chelsea        unless can produce a surprise result at anfield   everton be surely too far behind        the whole    picture be complicate   many feel united still have the potential to stage a late run into a champions league placing   though game in hand be not necessarily an advantage when be the only side in the equation still involve in europe   although this be undoubtedly the tight   most intriguing    situation the champions league qualifying process have bring about   for arsenal or united to break in   someone above will have to slip up quite badly   there be various reason why that may happen        harry kane  s absence could affect spurs   city  s defence could go walkabout again   liverpool may be stymie by a succession of team keep man behind the ball and play cagey at the back        though on the whole those scenario seem as unlikely as chelsea blow from here   put another way   seem much more likely that united will tire and drop point and that arsenal will continue to be out of sort and a source of exasperation to supporter and manager   that be not to say there will be no movement within the top four        liverpool  s gentle    be in contrast to city  s   who must play at arsenal and chelsea in the space of week        but with no distraction apart from the fa cup   how quaint   be hard to see why any of the present top four would surrender champions league status from this point on   even allow for the tenacity that team in the relegation battle can show at this stage in the season   spurs   city and liverpool all have enough game against side low in the table to keep ahead of the chaser   be the chaser who have the more demanding     united still have to play five team from the top seven   include city   arsenal and spurs away   while arsenal in present disarray will not find easy to pick up point against city   spurs   united and everton   not to mention stoke away from home   the flipside of that argument be that have so many game against direct rival give a real chance if can win   could be say   for instance   that united  s destiny be still in own hand and if beat everton   chelsea   city   arsenal and spurs would do champions league hope a power of good while simultaneously harm the side above and around   not too many united fan will be hold breath   win the europa league may be easy than that and even jos  mourinho have start to sound less sanguine about chance of qualify through the league   while united

misinformation from the    movement   include founder andrew wakefield   immunization rate plummet in a community of somali immigrant in minnesota   cause a measle outbreak among child     a disturbing trend on the rise in america that show the importance of immunization and the dangerous power of misinformation   a new paper publish in plos one by john cook   stephan lewandowsky   and ullrich ecker test the power of inoculation not against disease   but against the sort of misinformation that create the condition lead to minnesota measle outbreak   inoculation theory suggest that expose people to the trick use to spread misinformation can equip with the tool to recognize and reject such bogus claim   the study focus specifically on misinformation about climate change   the scientist want to determine if inoculation could boost people   resistance to false balance in the medium   and effort to cast doubt on the      expert consensus on    global warming   the two issue be connect        in climate story   journalist will often present argument by climate scientist and climate denier with equal weight   create the perception of a    split when in reality        of expert be on one side   as elegantly illustrate by john oliver in this clip with over   million view from hbo program last week tonight   in one experiment   before show people a medium story with this sort of climate false balance   the study author first provide a group with information about the      expert consensus   and deliver an   inoculation   explain the misleading effect of false balance medium coverage   find that in the group that be only expose to the false balance story   average perceive consensus   acceptance of    global warming   trust in climate scientist   and support for climate policy all fall   when subject be first inoculate against false balance and tell about the expert consensus   these factor instead all increase   the author conclude   in sum   the effect of    medium coverage have the great effect on perceive consensus among the various climate attitude measure   however   a consensus message present with the    message be effective in increase perceive consensus   thus neutralize the negative influence of the misinformation   in addition   find that an inoculation message be effective in neutralize the effect of misinformation on perceive consensus   in a second experiment   expose participant to consensus misinformation via the infamous oregon petition   explain in the video below   and again inoculate one group against the misinformation   the inoculation this time consist of a mixture of text and a figure of a tobacco ad with the text            physicians say   luckie be less irritate     to show participant a similar previous example of the fake expert technique employ in the oregon petition     as in the first experiment   exposure to only the misinformation decrease participant perception of the expert consensus   acceptance of    global warming   and support for climate policy   however   exposure to the inoculation offset the effect of the misinformation   ask lead author john cook how these finding can be implement in the real world where misinformation about subject like climate science and vaccine be pervasive   one of the unique element of the inoculation test in study be that never actually mention the myth that be inoculate against   instead   explain the general fallacy that the misinformation employ    the technique of use fake expert to cast doubt on expert agreement on a scientific topic   this tell that explain the technique of denial can help people spot attempt to mislead   hence neutralize misinformation that use those technique   arguably   the most effective way to practically implement inoculation be in the classroom   decade of research have find that one of the most powerful way to teach science be through    learning   teach science by directly address misconception and misinformation about the science   two way have put this into practice be through a massive open online course on climate science denial that use the      approach and a college textbook that teach climate science while debunk common climate myth     in short   the more explain the technique of science denial and misinformation   the more people will become inoculated against   when be expose to example of people use cherrypicking or fake expert or false balance to mislead the public   become easy to recognize those technique   and be less likely to fall for in the future   teach people to recognize those technique be a primary goal of the denial   x free online course mention by cook   when    andrew wakefield be confront with the consequence of misinform the somali immigrant in

stand in a union hall in indianapolis and breathe in that glorious odor of industrial beer mix with decade of cigarette residue   the sweet fragrance of youth   and what be here to say be that the midwest be not an exotic place   be not a benighted region of unknowable people and mysterious urge   be not backward or hopelessly superstitious or hostile to learn   be solid   familiar   ordinary america   and democrats can have no excuse for not see the wave of heartland rage that swamp last november     another thing that be inexcusable from democrats   surprise at the economic disaster that

use   physical activity and maternal education   however   even with the report  s limitation   be still one of the first to argue that reduce air pollution could also be effective in reduce premature

exposure     indoor cooking fire could play a large role than the study allow for     the exposure in asia   and in part in say   china and india   to outdoor air pollution be significantly high than

     as many as       million associate birth   notably   even though china have a relatively low rate of preterm birth   researcher find that as many as           preterm birth could be associate

strike over a price dispute   but a more ominous and    threat to livelihood may be on the horizon   a new study in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences have find a link between warm ocean condition and a dangerous neurotoxin that build up in sea life   domoic acid   seafood lover get a glimpse of that threat in        when record high ocean temperature and linger toxic algae bloom raise the domoic acid in shellfish to unsafe level   shut down the west coast dungeness crab fishery from alaska to southern california for several month   though less dramatic   the problem emerge again this season   when harvesting be again delay for portion of the coast   domoic acid be a toxin produce by    a micro algae which can accumulate in specie like dungeness crab   clam   mussel and anchovy   can be harmful to both human and wildlife   include sea lion and bird   remember the famous alfred hitchcock movie   the birds   be inspire by a    incident of california seabird drive into a frenzy by the neurotoxin   although be start to hear about domoic acid more often     be on the radar of public health official since a canadian outbreak in      kill three and sicken over       in mild case   can cause vomiting   diarrhea and abdominal cramp   severe case can cause trouble breathing   memory loss   and even coma or death   in the case of dungeness crab   the food chain look like this   the phytoplankton    produce the toxin domoic acid during an algae bloom   zooplankton and filter feeder   like clam and mussel   then eat that phytoplankton     interestingly   not all shellfish react the same way   mussel   for example   be able to rid of the toxin within a few week   while domoic acid may linger in clam for several month   even up to a year     those delicious dungeness crab like so much have a taste for clam   which be where domoic acid can be pass up the food chain to human   official be able to test for unsafe level   keep taint seafood out of

allow to look at from a different perspective than anyone have previously     say morgaine mckibben   a ph   d  candidate at oregon state university and lead author of the new study   the researcher look at    datum collect from oregon razor clam   copepod   zooplankton that drift with the current and be study to predict salmon run   and recur climate pattern know as the pacific decadal oscillation and el nino southern oscillation   and be able to establish that domoic acid event   like those that have be impact the west coast dungeness crab fishery   be strongly related to warm phase in the ocean     the most important takeaway from the study be that   tell about change in the food web base on    observation of change in the ocean     a very zoomed out view of how the food web respond to natural change to ocean condition   that   very important when talk about resource management     say mckibben   these type of    record be somewhat rare in oceanography   say   because     hard to find funding to keep consistent observation like this go     and a future with more frequent domoic acid event seem likely   say say bill peterson   a noaa senior scientist and    of the study     be have more and more of these warm ocean event and be go to have more domoic acid bloom each year   may become a chronic problem     say   that paint a troubling picture for crab fisherman like bob eder of newport   oregon while domoic acid may go away for a year or two as a problem     be something will now be deal with for a long time     say   also worry about how future domoic acid event could impact export        critically important to boost the overall price of whole crab   while americans typically eat only the meat from the crab   chinese consumer also eat what   know as the   butter     or gut   of the crab   where domoic acid tend to be more concentrated   official from the california department of public health say test    for toxic phytoplankton at more than     sample site along the entire california coastline   and that      be the first year domoic acid be find in crab meat   oregon and washington have similar sampling strategy   and have collaborate with california on dungeness crab test over the last two year   but peterson think state vulnerable to domoic acid event should be do even more testing     should sample more often and over a wide      area     say peterson     crab harvest be a huge money maker on the west coast   can not have people think be go to get sick from eat crab   pretty soon   state   be go to have to sample more often

board in an attempt to streamline vast operation   taylor have recently invent a theory of   time management   in which the same principle use to optimize machine be apply to people   taylor stalk the floor of the bethlehem plant arm with a stopwatch and a clipboard note the time take for worker to complete task   like load iron bar onto waiting railcar   taylor  s eventual recommendation to the company  s executive be simple   the worker should be make to do more in less time   some     year later   the plan taylor lay out for big business have now become internalize within all   call the   personal productivity movement       subtly weave into the fabric of digitally mediate life   that   not a good thing   there be an argument to be make that emphasis on personal productivity be not only slowly kill     also doom to fail   in fact   this exact argument be make in a piece of    journalism by oliver burkeman in the guardian late last month   since last book focus on the link between change cultural     and change scientific conception of time   find a lot to agree with in burkeman  s piece   so   today   let spend a few moment unpack mania for personal productivity   historical root        and the reason why   a long road to nowhere   google   personal productivity   and   pretty quickly   will get the gist of what this movement mean   there   the   the   rules of personal productivity   and     simple rule to extreme personal productivity   and      suggestion to boost personal productivity     clearly   there be a lot of rule   here be a few of   write thing down avoid distraction schedule email and social medium check balance focus work with focused rest   there be   not surprisingly   personal productivity app to help stick to these rule   some will keep list and help prioritize   other go further   for example there   atracker to help track   repetitive daily routine at work     and eternity time log that allow to   track many project and    generate and export detailed hierarchical report to know exactly where time go     burkeman correctly link the birth of this mania for efficiency and productivity with frederick taylor  s scientific time management   but while be big business that keep worker   at the sharp end   of taylor  s proposal   in digital age have mostly volunteer to do that job   to     the reason for this be manifold   much of the gospel of personal productivity begin with an eye towards job   since live in an age where can answer    email at   p  m  well   then   should not   be risk position by not answer   as burkeman put     in an era of insecure employment   must constantly demonstrate usefulness through frenetic do     but   as burkeman show   the new and inherently unfair economic condition drive the range for personal productivity will not change outcome   as explain     an awkward truth about taylor  s celebrated efficiency drive be that be not very successful   bethlehem steel fire in        have pay vast sum without any clearly detectable impact on own profit     one persistent consequence of scheme be that seem promise at first   but leave worker too exhausted to function consistently over the long term     exhaustion   that   the key word   that   why personal productivity effort be bind to fail in the same way fail in taylor  s day   in modern   digitally render age be all be catch by the promise that can squeeze more out of time   by abstract life into a series of digitally manipulatable list   be tell can optimize   in this way   come to believe really can get more quality parenting time   while still get to the gym everyday   while still read more book   while still learn to cook indian food and so on and on and on   the list literally go on forever        and that   the problem   the list be a lie   what strike most when be write book about the braid evolution of scientific and cultural time be the role of invention in both   find that every culture invent way of parse the day   these be what call cultural     be nothing more than social construction build from the imagination and the dominant technology each culture have at disposal   i  e  rope and sail   gear and spring   wire and silicon chip     the real point be that none of be any more real than other   a culture build on hunting and gathering would have one way of organize the day   while one build on farming would have another   neither be more   true   than the other   but see from within   each culture      be invisible   seem obvious   seem give   just be   from that vantage point   mania for personal productivity be just a reflection of the technology have build modern culture upon   machine now parse time in nanosecond chunk   do more than early machine could because make more time by move faster     however   do not have that option   even though digital technology give tool to exactly meter time   be not really time     not the kind of time be bear to as biological entity enmesh in a live world   burkeman rightly end essay by point out how much of mania for personal productivity can be trace back to a much old impulse        a fear of death     the more can convince that need never make difficult choice        because there will be enough time for everything        the less will feel obliged to ask whether the life be choose be the right one     that be where the choice come back to   every culturally impose    be an invention     something make up   the    dream up in build this new version of society have some great aspect   not because allow to do more thing but because allow to do thing could not do before   that should be enough   lie to if think can get more out of time   that   because   ultimately   the time get will always be all the time

mental health disorder have try the program   this strategy be not without drawback   abas say   the community counselor require continual training and supervision   which be why report to a district supervisor with more formal medical and psychological training   and funding be another issue   right now   the program depend on grant money the researcher say that the government will eventually have to pitch in to sustain the program   despite those complication       just a great model   and   impressive     say brandon kohrt   an assistant professor of psychiatry at duke university who be not involve in the development of the friendship bench program or in the recent study       often very stigmatize to have to go to a mental health professional     kohrt say     so   great that approach do not require people to go to a location        like a psychiatric hospital        that be see as somewhere only really ill incurable people go     the program also attest to the power of community   say kohrt   and harness the community to support those suffer mental illness   believe that   the lesson from this can be apply globally   even in high income country     for florence manyande   at least   beyond help quell suicidal thought   the friendship bench have help build the sort of community have be crave   at a group therapy session   manyande say     make a friend who

be update as other appointment be make   at a thursday press conference   donald trump name one more person to list of cabinet nominee   alexander acosta   dean of the florida international university college of law and former member of the national labor relations board   be now nominate to head the labor department   be take the place of andrew puzder   who drop out of the process this week in part due to question about past employment of person in the country illegally   include taxis pay in that instance   and personal life   npr be track trump  s cabinet as grow   count up the diversity and experience of appointee   as well as a few specific may have in resume   so here   what trump  s cabinet look like by the number   acosta  s nomination mean that    of       position   not count the vice president   will have nominee        the cea still do not have a nomination for chairman   for the sake of     comparison   have compare all of those    post across five president   initial cabinets   for trump only count everything as a percentage of      as have only choose    people   and for reagan and clinton   only count    appointee   as there be no department of homeland security during presidency     trump  s cabinet break with a trend toward diversity   of the    people have choose thus far   trump  s cabinet have    white man   that   roughly in line with ronald reagan  s initial cabinet   however     also a swing away from a trend toward diversity over the last few president   president obama  s cabinet in particular gain notice for relative lack of white man   to draw a line between white and nonwhite   use census bureau race and ethnicity category   though unlike the census   count all hispanics as nonwhite   the census bureau count hispanic as an ethnicity and not a race   mean a person can be white and hispanic     alexander acosta be the first latino appointee to the trump cabinet   the census bureau  s system undersell diversity in some way   though   for example   obama transportation secretary ray lahood   george w  bush energy secretary spencer abraham   and clinton hhs secretary donna shalala be all     in the census   that count as white   though some    disagree   and the census bureau be consider add that category     furthermore     not that the trend toward diversity have be as steady as the above chart seem to show after all   these be just the president   first cabinets   president obama take some criticism for a less diverse circle of adviser in second term   diversity can mean bring different perspective to the administration   of course   white man can be empathetic and    as national urban league head marc morial recently tell pbs newshour   but many americans also look to the cabinet as a sign of whether be       the question be   do people feel voice be hear   that   really important   that community feel someone be at the table with point of view     say   trump have choose the outsider cabinet   of course   there be other type of diversity        geographic   socioeconomic and experience   for example   and while trump  s team have be criticize for economic profile   i  e  include multiple billionaire   do break with usual cabinet norm by be relatively light on establish government figure   have attempt to quantify this by classify each cabinet member by or most prominent job prior to join the cabinet   for example   colin powell have spend much of work life in the military before join george w  bush  s cabinet     this require more than a few judgment call        glenn hubbard   george w  bush  s cea chair   have spend two year at the treasury   but decide be primarily an academic   as spend many more year in that field   some of these be arguable   be hillary clinton  s career more prominently in   government          that is   time as senator        or as a first lady   which would classify as   other     a category that include people who be in politic but be not officeholder   like reince priebus     make one of the few list as more than one   as straddle the line between the two world   here can see not only whose cabinet be particularly heavy with people from the public sector   obama   or the business world   reagan   trump   but also where different president have break with tradition   trump   like most of the last five president   will have someone from the business world head the small business administration   however   will be the only president out of these to have a defense secretary   mattis   with a chiefly military background   true   donald rumsfeld have be in the military   but afterward make a career of work in government   while mattis remain in the military through retirement   for a more holistic count of these cabinet secretary   career   here be a breakdown of four different distinction that cabinet secretary commonly hold   count up the initial cabinet member who have have any experience in the military or government   at any level   from city to federal   as well as those who have serve as ceo or have earn ph   d   s     this mean these number will differ from those in the above table   someone know best for government service may also have serve in the military or have a ph   d  or have be a ceo   for example        or even all four     once again   there be some judgment call        do serve as the   ceo   of chicago public schools        as obama education secretary arne duncan do        really count as be a ceo     decide no be try to count a type of business experience here   and public school be a government entity   a similar but tough call go into decide that timothy geithner  s time as new york fed ceo do not count either     one other judgment call   draw the line at ph   d  s and exclude professional degree   mean that someone like ben carson   who of course study extensively to be a neurosurgeon   would not be count   there be also some debate about whether someone hold a law degree   a j  d  or juris doctor   should be consider a   doctor     for simplicity  s sake   decide to draw border at ph   d  this be not mean to imply that these be the only four way someone may be qualified to serve as a cabinet secretary   rather   these be four way of measure what type of a cabinet a president have   a cabinet that   relatively heavy with academic   obama   clinton   may work and think differently than do a cabinet with more ceo   trump   george w  bush

blockchain have the potential to do more than send money   can help people store information securely and permanently on the web   for economist and technologist who work in the develop world   this open up a world of opportunity   what if blockchain could be use as a force for good        a safe place   say   for a poor kenyan farmer to store the document that prove really do own land   how do work   exactly   imagine have a bit of important information that would like to store on the web   like a birth or health care record   may choose to store in one of many blockchain network to keep those datum safe   to do that   must add record to something call a   block     a chunk of datum on the web   but that   just the first step   to be archive        in other word   to become a permanent record        data must be link to the   blockchain   in a global network of million of computer   think of the blockchain as a   st century version of the    paper ledger that business once use to keep track of transaction   once the block be link to the chain   everyone in the network get an update copy   so if one computer get shut down   that   not a problem   the million of other in

sell to another party   for example   some middleman be not willing to serve everybody   poor people   for example   may not have enough money to open a bank account   and there   another problem   the middleman could also be hack   once datum be part of the blockchain     difficult to change or remove those datum   a group of special user in the network   call miner   help keep honest by verify

,  editor  s note   a sentence in paragraph    contain language that may be offensive to some reader     would be comical if not so serious   or perhaps serious if not so tragicomic   certainly   have an author or screenwriter suggest what american politic have see this week   would have be judge unbelievable   the trump presidency have not even begin   this week may yet be the peak of insanity   the moment at which the compete group and power center        medium outlet   intelligence agency   political party   foreign superpower        just throw everything can out there before the administration really get go   what be equally plausible   however   be that this be only the beginning   even as president barack obama be finish    final speech in chicago   incoming successor be take to twitter in furious capital letter   force to respond to the suggestion have be compromise by russian intelligence who provide salacious detail of alleged sexual act in moscow   online and in wednesday press conference   trump brand the allegation   fake news   the phrase use to describe the grow number of false online news story that have proliferate over the internet and social medium   in reality   the situation appear more complex   accord to multiple report   the dossier publish late tuesday by buzzfeed        source to a suppose former british intelligence official   hire by a washington political research firm        have be take seriously enough to be discuss at the high level in washington   d  c  include the presidency   trump be say to have    a    summary of the allegation in a classified report intelligence official give last week        although say will not discuss what be say in that meeting   no one know whether the allegation be true        the reason so many other medium outlet choose not to publish   nor be the dossier in any sense the most important thing happen in the world   even this week   a chinese aircraft carrier be on wednesday nose way through the taiwan strait   u  s  and iranian force be square off in the indian ocean after an incident earlier in the week   and european power be still struggle to find way through a myriad range of interlink crisis   from the migrant crisis to brexit to the future of the euro   the rise of the far right and own confrontation with russia   and as if that be not enough   north korea        which may yet prove the most serious flashpoint of             be move closer to most sophisticated ballistic missile test yet   foreign affair   of course   have rarely be trump  s number one priority   in first press conference since the election   be clearly much more keen to focus on economic and job plan as well as the future of the trump organization   almost all the medium question   however   focus on russia   the risk for trump be that the reality or otherwise of the allegation cease to be the point   the fact be so widely known just undermine credibility   the justification buzzfeed use for release the admittedly dodgy dossier be that the material be already circulate widely within the corridor of power in washington and beyond   that   a reasonable argument        but in scatter the allegation more broadly   have almost guarantee that the story will never go away   that   important for a couple of reason   first   mean that question of trump and russia   will more likely drag on throughout administration   much as some of the allegation against bill clinton   sexual and otherwise   do throughout presidency   already   senior figure in congress be look to push ahead with hearing on election hacking and perhaps broad russian interference in u  s  politic   even at the very good   trump may find the butt of joke and suffer a drip feed of gossip and innuendo   that be   of course   true before   even the bare scan of the internet and social medium overnight   however suggest the more graphic material in the dossier will linger in the public mind for year   like similarly    suggestion about former british prime minister david cameron and a pig   actual veracity barely matter   be possible   of course   that this be always russian president vladimir putin  s strategy        to build trump up   get in the white house   but trash reputation   give or spy credit for a plan that devious   however   may well be too generous   the most damaging allegation   if true   would be those that suggest senior member of the trump campaign reach out directly to russian official during the campaign   some of the claim in the dossier about trump associate meet russian official already appear to be false      at the end of the press conference   however   trump pointedly fail to answer question about whether any contact between team and russian official take place   even if the entire dossier   true   that would not necessarily mean that trump be somehow   compromised     indeed   one could even argue that the fact that these story be now out there make hard for anyone in moscow to blackmail the u  s  president   if trump could win an election despite be record say could   grab   woman   by the pussy   be unlikely to be undo by anything may have be up to in the moscow    hotel   what may be just as dangerous   however   be that may now feel have no choice but to take a much tough line with putin        and possibly other u  s  adversarie        in a way that may prove equally destabilizing   perhaps even catastrophically dangerous   may have already see early sign of this   at confirmation hear wednesday   secretary of state nominee rex tillerson        who be close to putin as exxon mobil ceo        also signal a rather tough than expect line   as well as keep u  s  sanction in place   appear open to suggestion of increase military support to

what can to disrupt and generally cause chaos within the u  s  political system   have be do so in part because putin blame the obama administration for support opposition group in russia   both

which u  s  intelligence agency and official have also throw into the political maelstrom be also distinctly destabilizing   from the fbi reopen investigation into hillary clinton  s email mere day before the election to u  s  spy brief the medium on allegation against trump   be all deepen distrust in a way that will make run the trump white house much   much more difficult the irony   of course   be that trump  s own rise be so impossible to divorce from many of these trend   chief political selling point   after all   have always be lack of political correctness and unpredictability   the rise of unsourced and sometimes outright false   fake news   arguably do much to help and undermine clinton  s campaign   now   however   a similar kind of rumor and conjecture could undermine

130182,195811,There’s a revolution happening in electricity. Utilities need to keep up.,Vox,David Roberts,2017/1/19,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/19/14229090/revolution-electricity-utilities,  electric utility increasingly find at war with own customer   homeowner and commercial building owner have all sort of new choice for how to generate   store   and manage own electricity        solar panel   home battery   electric vehicle   smart thermostat and appliance   and more gizmo come along every day        the more take advantage of these new   distribute energy resource     less power buy from utility   turn out utility do not like that   right now   utility do not control any of those distribute energy resource   ders   which tend to be locate on the customer side of the electricity meter     behind the meter       utility have no visibility into ders   do not know how value or make use of   and do not know how to plan for     what   more   the regulatory model under which utility operate put at odd with der     this explain the many fight play out across the country over   net metering     which require utility to compensate rooftop solar owner   i  e  competitor             an unfortunate situation   because der could be useful to utility   provide grid not only energy but additional flexibility and stability   utility just have to figure out how to adapt       that   easy say than do   though   electric utility tend to be heavily regulated monopoly with guarantee return   operate in a market where the basic underlying technology have   until recently   not change substantially in decade     not a model that encourage nimble innovation     the sector be now face with the need for rapid   responsive change   but lack the mindset and resource       to help confused utility   a team of researcher at the mit energy initiative have put together a guide   the utility of the future   a magisterial      report that exhaustively document the shortcoming of the current system and various tool and model available to utility and regulator to help cope with change that be   by now   unstoppable   call jesse jenkins   a doctoral student work on the project at mit   to walk through   be join in the beginning by bob armstrong   the director of the mit energy initiative     just as a friendly warning   the conversation get pretty deep in the weed   and use some terminology that may not be familiar to     along the way   will explain key term and concept in    to help everyone follow along   to be clear   everything inside the    be language   add after the fact       let jump in   an edited transcript of conversation follow   david roberts   what   in essence   be the problem with today  s electricity system   jesse jenkins individual household and business be start to face a whole new set of option for how provide or consume electricity   everything from rooftop solar panel to electric vehicle to smart thermostat   that unprecedented degree of choice require a new set of policy and regulation   to make sure that people be make decision that be smart for and also help low cost or improve the performance of the power system as a whole      bob armstrong yes   so the challenge be not so much that the industry be look to change the system   but   change under foot   understand that   change   but be unsure how to respond to those change   the idea in this study be to inform how good to take advantage of these distribute energy resource   where good to put to optimize cost and impact   and how to exploit information and communication technology   david roberts sense be that most us utility be fight rearguard battle against ders   how much of that be real hostility versus just not know what else to do   bob armstrong   uncertainty about the future   not know what business model be go to look like go forward   hold on to what have get be more comfortable       jesse jenkins a variety of friction emerge any time the fundamental set of technology and choice in a marketplace change     and in a regulated marketplace like electricity   where regulation and policy have a pervasive role     difficult for utility to adapt to those change and implement own strategy unless regulation and policy be as proactive and innovative as want regulated business to become     so that   a big piece of what be try to do in this report   lay out the regulatory and institutional framework to allow that revolution to occur in a    way   both on the utility   side of thing and on the electricity customer side of thing     david roberts one recur theme in the report be that the value of power vary base on time and location   explain why that   true and why matter so much   jesse jenkins the cost of deliver electricity to end consumer change across time and location due to the variability of electricity demand       have certain power plant that be only run to meet peak demand   and those tend to be more expensive when be run        here in new england   still burn oil for about   percent of electricity   mostly during    period in winter and summer   in other place     natural gas plant that be less efficient   or old coal plant   so inefficient power plant   around to meet those    period   have a high cost for every megawatt hour that produce     basically build the power system to meet peak requirement   would be like try to build a highway that never have congestion   or traffic jam   may need forty lane   to make sure that on no day during the year would ever have a traffic jam   that   how build the grid today   to meet peak demand and have power       meet demand in period of the year when electricity demand be really high can become very costly   and lead to investment in new capacity or generation from power plant that be very expensive     and then power grid can become congested   so sometimes have to turn on more expensive power plant on the other side of that congestion   that lead to different cost for deliver energy in different part of the grid     so both time and location matter for the cost of energy   then why do that matter to consumer     well   do not matter much when do not have any ability to respond   be passive consumer of electricity   but if be try to decide whether to buy a smart thermostat and use to control ac load   or when to charge electric vehicle   or whether   worth to to put solar panel on house face south   where produce the most power   or face west   where produce power later in the afternoon        do not have the signal to guide those investment in an efficient way   unless know whether   more valuable for to generate power at a give time or give location        david roberts so want to get those price signal to consumer and distribute power producer       jesse jenkins tend to have very good   granular price signal in   wholesale   electricity market         those price signal   reflect   at least at the transmission level   these variation in price across time and location      pricing be use in most wholesale electricity market in the united states          but do not send those price signal on to the demand side   and that mean be probably overbuilde the amount of generation need   or make costly decision about transmission expansion   be not unlock the flexibility in demand and distribute resource that could if have well price signal   that would lead to smart decision by everyone and low cost for electricity     david roberts in term of the technology require to send and receive those signal   be just smart meter       jesse jenkins need some form of interval metering   something that can measure consumption not just every month   but on an hourly or even more frequent basis   that could be the traditional utility smart meter or could be some new ict   internet and communication technology   solution that emerge in the future     one thing want to note be that this report be intend to be about the utility of the future      year from now or so   not tomorrow morning   so be expect a lot of additional change and particularly improvement in the cost of ict     but yeah   need some capability to measure and record the pattern of consumption and injection into the grid each user have        bob armstrong of course   there be go to be issue with cybersecurity and personal datum security        those need to get resolve at the same time     not just a matter of have smart meter   but there   go to be a lot of system capability and infrastructure that need to be put in place before this can work efficiently and securely     david roberts another distinction that come up repeatedly be between utility capital expenditure   capex   and operate expenditure   opex         talk about how cost be shift from the former to the latter   but the current utility regulatory model inhibit that   say a little bit about that shift     jesse jenkins be focus here on distribution company that run the    power grid that deliver energy to consumer        how meet demand for the way people use network     traditionally   utility have invest in thing like more transformer or new power line and other hard equipment   to meet growth and peak demand on grid        go forward   there   more flexibility on the consumer side of the meter and more opportunity for embed distribute resource throughout the grid in the location that be most valuable   utility have the opportunity to contract with   incentivize   or otherwise pay distribute resource to help solve    problem        without necessarily invest in own asset     so that would look like a shift from a traditional capital expenditure   like a new substation   to a series of contract or payment for performance to distribute energy resource owner or aggregator or other intermediary      david roberts    some utility say do not need to change the basic regulatory model   just need to let invest in ders and    like    infrastructure investment       jesse jenkins outside of vertically integrate    market   generally caution against have regulate network utility own own distribute resource        that   for a couple reason   mostly relate to concern about the potential for conflict of interest   or the exercise of market power     utility   play a central role in every electricity market transaction        the network   the system that operate   and increasingly the market platform that may run     in order for that core platform function of the utility to be perform in an efficient and neutral manner     ideal that the utility responsible for manage those function do not have any particular interest or stake in the outcome of competitive   market   decision     address these issue    in the reform of wholesale energy market and bulk power system in the      and     s        the restructure era   that ultimately lead to the creation of independent system operator   isos   independent third party that have the responsibility for manage the   transmission   grid in the united states   in europe   be transmission system operator that both own the grid and operate but be bar from be active participant in competitive market     outline a set of similar concern about the role of distribution utility   which be become more important   be now at the heart of the electricity marketplace more than be in the past     if regulation be establish well   and utility be neutral about capital investment or operational investment   then should be agnostic as to whether own the asset or whether contract with a third party   and   well from a regulatory perspective that do not have any financial stake in the competitive provision of distribute energy resource     instead     should   focus on procure the service need to run the grid from whoever be the cheap provider of that service        david roberts say have electricity price that capture all the relevant time and location value of energy          pricing for retail electricity market   then would have   theoretically   a perfectly transparent and efficient retail market for electricity     do not that mean that any other cost or charge introduce        grid maintenance cost   policy cost   what have        be   almost by definition   go to distort the price signal and make the market less efficient       jesse jenkins question be well framed   if have the right price signal   that accurately convey the marginal cost of consume electricity   anything add on top of that be go to change what people want to do and move away from the efficient outcome   and so for residual network cost and policy cost   recommend remove those from volumetric charge and add to a fix    payment   which would not distort    behavior         david roberts be not there equity concern with a    charge   by use more energy   wealthy people use the grid more   should not pay more     jesse jenkins do acknowledge an important equity concern   do not comment on in this report because there be any number of different way that the charge can be allocate to different customer   there   not really a guide principle from economic   as far as efficiency   for how best how to do that   except to do in a way that be minimally distortive of the efficient pricing signal     so basically   society have to decide   what   a fair way to pay for the public service that get from the grid   or the public policy objective that tend to tack on to electricity bill     protect    ratepayer   raise fund for    program   or pay for sink network asset that everybody benefit from        these be all important goal   and can be achieve without sacrifice the efficient price signal that need to guide all of the myriad distribute decision maker on the power grid now     for example   if be concerned about    resident pay too much in fix charge   can have a    credit   or reduction in the fixed charge   and a corresponding increase the fix charge for everyone else to cover for that   there be lot of way to address these equity concern without blunt or distort efficient price signal     the other possibility that raise   a little outside the box today   be that some of these cost   particularly the policy cost   may be good and most equitably distribute via taxis        david roberts do seem like public purpose    be properly fund through taxis   that have always strike as the fair way to do        shift policy cost out of electricity rate   into a progressive tax      jesse jenkins only pay for a portion of road with user fee   in the form of gas taxis   some come from general fund   raise by income and property taxis   everyone pay for public school   regardless of whether send kid to those school   so there be certainly plenty of precedent for allocate public policy objective   or infrastructure that have an amenity benefit   to everybody     what make this an important conversation   now or maybe in    year   be if somebody defect from the grid entirely   to avoid share of sunk cost or policy cost   those cost do not go away   get shift to someone else        other ratepayer or utility shareholder     important think through those implication carefully       david roberts there   a lot of activism right now around net metering      but actually violate a number of the principle in report   how would explain that to a    fan   jesse jenkins the problem with    be not necessarily the   net   part     the fact that   net out flat volumetric rate that do not accurately reflect the value of electricity production or the cost of consumption   there   basically no incentive to have flexible ac load or install a storage device when be charge the same exact price every hour of the day and every day of the year     the second challenge be that   net metering   do not help understand the good place to put solar   and at what scale   flat volumetric rate do not convey either of those thing     for example   in california   or germany   where there   a lot of solar already deploy   the value of production from solar panel in the middle of the day be get quite low   lower every year   but   still pretty high in the afternoon at   or   or   pm     so may actually be more beneficial to put panel face west   so produce more power in the afternoon   than to put face south   so produce more kilowatt hour in total   but with flat volumetric rate   have no way of know that   or incentive to do so     david roberts there be several   value of solar   study go on for utility      seem like the beginning of what could be an endless series of   value of x      hearing     jesse jenkins exactly     those effort be an important step   in that start break down the individual value stream or service that solar may provide   and how much each be worth   to the individual and to the grid as a whole     important because recognize that the rate use now   the simple volumetric average rate   bear no resemblance to that value or cost     but recommend shift from think about the value of a specific technology to think about the value of electricity consumption or injection at different time and different place        basically the value of the service   rather than the value of the technology   that   important for practical reason   because   like say   if try to define the     tariff   then need the     tariff   the        tariff   the      tariff   etc     become very impractical to define all those different tariff and the value of each of in a way that   consistent and do not cause distortion or encourage people to game those system     be important to recognize that multiple technology and behavior can all provide the same limited set of service to the grid     for example   there   a lot of focus right now on energy storage   which be become a more affordable and potentially valuable part of the grid   and that   lead to specific policy support for energy storage   but a lot of the service that energy storage provide could also be provide by demand response or flexible demand       do not know a priori what   go to be cheap to provide those service   be go to be energy storage   if so   what kind of storage   be go to be flexible demand or demand response   fuel cell that generate during the right time     this be not just about solar     about give people the right set of incentive to make the right choice across a whole range of different option   and that require to think about the value of service to the grid   rather than try to add up all the particular service that an individual technology may provide     david roberts talk about way utility could boost research and experimentation   do not seem    to   at least today     jesse jenkins utilities have little financial incentive   if any   to pursue    risky innovation   unless the regulatory environment direct to do so   remember   these be regulate monopoly     need mechanism that encourage utility to engage in   not fundamental research or basic science   but the kind of      project and demonstration project that can accelerate the uptick of novel technology     and just as importantly   learn about the capability of those technology and disseminate that knowledge across the industry help make the   properly      utility more comfortable with these new technology   and more likely to integrate into service     david roberts but be not regulator breed to the bone to focus on reliability and     experimentation make nervous   jesse jenkins do not think pursue innovation have to undermine reliability   in fact   could generate new tool to improve the reliability of the grid and fortify against threat like strong storm   flooding   and cyberattack   the basic regulatory principle be that want to ensure that electricity service do not cost any more than should        particularly   any more than would if the utility be act like a competitive business     and any competitive business in a change marketplace   where technology and option for provide service be evolve   would have some degree of research and development and demonstration   learn activity to understand what the future may look like     lower cost for ratepayer do not just mean low cost today   also mean low cost over time   if do not invest in learning and innovation   ratepayer be go to pay more in the long term than should for energy    
130183,195812,Obamaism sought strength in unity. Trumpism finds power through division.,Vox,Ezra Klein,2017/1/20,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/20/14339024/trump-inaugural-divisions-obama,  barack obama burst onto the national scene with a speech deny the power        deny even the reality        of the deep division that seem to define american politic          the pundit like to slice and dice country into red state and blue state   red state for republicans   blue state for democrats     say in          but have get news for   too   worship an awesome god in the blue state   and do not like federal agent poke around library in the red states          inaugural speech hold to the theme     on this day   come to proclaim an end to the petty grievance and false promise   the recrimination and    dogmas that for far too long have strangle politic   remain a young nation   but in the word of scripture   the time have come to set aside childish thing                  this be obamaism   the theory that the widen gyre between democrats and republicans be an illusion whip up by political consultant   that bitter partisanship be a childish thing that could be put aside to solve america  s tough problem       obamaism be wrong   and now obamaism be over     donald trump  s inaugural address   like campaign   be notable in part for how uninterested be in healing division   do not pretend dispute be illusory   do not suggest division would be easy to bridge   be perfectly clear about whom be speak to and whom be not         the forget man and woman of country will be forget no longer     promise     everyone be listen to now   come by the ten of million to become part of a historic movement   the like of which the world have never see before                        this be the most striking word of trump  s speech   trump do not use     to denote america       be trump  s america        the people who be part of historic movement   there be no effort in the speech to reach out to muslims or immigrant or woman or anyone else trump have scare during the campaign   there be no talk of compromise policy or unexpected alliance   there be no suggestion that political rhetoric have go too far   and a period of listening   and healing   could now be expect   even trump  s mention of dissent come in a vaguely threatening passage       at the bedrock of politic will be a total allegiance to the united states of america   and through loyalty to country will rediscover loyalty to each other   when open heart to patriotism   there be no room for prejudice   the bible tell how good and pleasant be when god  s people live together in unity   must speak mind openly   debate disagreement honestly   but always pursue solidarity   obama take office try to fight the rise tide of polarization   spend month   even year   negotiate with congressional republicans for vote that never come   trump be not go to waste that time   be under no illusion that will ever be a unifying figure   do not think need opponent to like   and do not try to win favor   instead   trump thrive on heighten the division in american politic     why tweet out attack on meryl streep and john lewis and hillary clinton and the   crooked medium     the fight create be bitter and unnecessary   but serve to rally supporter to side        if obama  s contention be that there   no       only       trump  s contention be that there really be a            a     of immigrant and muslims and terrorist and black live matter activist and elite and crooked journalist        and so   all the more important for the   us   to stick together     this be how win the primary     how win the election     how intend to govern   if obamaism be about strength through unity   trumpism be about power through division   party polarization be how trump win the presidency donald trump  s nearness to the presidency rest on two separate accomplishment        or   if prefer   two separate institutional failure        that be often conflate   the first be victory in the republican party  s presidential primary   the second be consolidation of elite republicans   and of the    electorate   trump win the gop primary with        million vote   the difference between those        million vote and the    million win in the general election be vast   and be by no mean assure     in        for instance   george mcgovern win the democratic primary even though much of the democratic party view with suspicion and even fear   major democratic interest group   like the    refuse to endorse in the general election   and top democrats   include former governor of florida   texas   and virginia   organize   democrats for nixon     mcgovern go on to lose with less than    percent of the vote   a dismal showing drive by democrats who abandon a nominee consider unacceptable   a similar path be possible for trump   elite within the republican party view with horror   primary opponent speak of in apocalyptic term   ted cruz call trump a   pathological liar       utterly amoral     and   a narcissist at a level do not think this country  s ever see     rick perry say trump  s candidacy be   a cancer on conservatism   and must be clearly diagnose   excise   and discard     rand paul say trump be   a delusional narcissist and an    windbag   a speck of dirt be way more qualified to be president     marco rubio call   dangerous     and warn that should not hand   the nuclear code of the united states to an erratic individual         and then every single one of those republicans endorse trump   ted cruz tell americans to vote for the pathological liar   rand paul back the delusional narcissist   marco rubio campaign to hand the nuclear code of the united states to an erratic individual   rick perry urge people to elect the cancer on conservatism   and today be prepare to serve as secretary of energy                the list go on   paul ryan   the republican speaker of the house of representatives   endorse trump   as do mitch mcconnell   the senate majority leader   and reince priebus   who be head of the republican national committee and be now trump  s chief of staff   mike pence   the governor of indiana   commiserate with dan senor   a former bush appointee   over the fact that trump be   unacceptable          and then become vice president   with this kind of elite consolidation     little wonder that trump manage to consolidate    voter behind   the final    poll of the election find that    percent of likely republican voter be support trump        precisely match the    percent of likely democratic voter support clinton   trump do not get mcgoverned   as jon levy write of the      election     should start by understand that partisan be very   very likely to vote for own party   candidate   regardless of those candidate   personal merit or indeed the substance of view   republicans will even vote for an opponent of free trade and of the postwar western alliance who grossly offend against conservative christian sexual more   if that   who be at the top of ticket     the bug in american democracy   weak party   strong partisanship political scientist julia azari have write the single most important sentence for understand both trump  s rise and this dangerous era in american politic     the define characteristic of moment be that party be weak while partisanship be strong     here be the problem   in short   party   and particularly the republican party   can no longer control whom nominate   but once nominate someone        once nominate anyone        that person be guarantee the support of both the party  s elite and voter   unlike in mcgovern  s day   when ticket splitting be common   any candidate able to win party  s presidential primary can now count on party  s support       political party   and political party primary   be traditionally bulwark against demagogue rise in american politic        be control by gatekeeper who act as check against charismatic demagogue   donald trump would never have make through the convention    that use to drive nomination   would never have survive a process that require support from party official   but this also present a puzzle   if partisan have lose so much faith in party establishment   then why be so much likeli to back whomever party nominate   the answer   in short   be fear and loathing of the other party   since        the american national election studies have be ask republicans and democrats to describe feeling toward the other party on a scale that run from cold and negative to warm and positive   in           percent of republicans have cold   negative feeling toward the democratic party   and    percent of democrats have cold   negative feeling toward the republican party   by        that have rise to    percent of republicans and    percent of democrats   today   fully    percent of republicans   and    percent of democrats   believe the other party  s policy   threaten the nation  s       this fear be strong among the most politically involve   which make sense   be more likely to take an active interest in american politic if think the stake be high   but that mean the people drive american politic        and particularly the people drive    party primary        have the most apocalyptic view of the other side               this be drive by the reality that the two party have grow more ideologically distant from each other   and so the stake of election really have grow large   in           percent of republicans be more liberal than the median democrat   and    percent of democrats be more conservative than the median republican   today only   percent of republicans be more liberal than the median democrat   and only   percent of democrats be more conservative than the median republican               and polarization beget polarization   the angrier and more fearful partisan be   the more of a market there be for medium that make yet angry and yet more fearful   be no accident that steve bannon   the former ceo of breitbart news   a    conservative medium outlet that specialize in scare the hell out of audience   be now trump  s chief strategist       trump  s speech today be all about make audience angrier and more fearful     the crime and the gang and the drug that have steal too many life and rob country of so much unrealized potential     grimace     this american carnage stop right here and stop right now       american carnage     those be the word trump  s speech will be remember for   do not describe the reality of america in        but paint a picture that will keep trump  s base afraid   angry   and on side   the downside of obamaism and the downside of trumpism trump boast inauguration would have an   unbelievable   perhaps    turnout     as the above photograph show   do not                there be no great mystery to this   trump be unpopular        more unpopular   in fact   than any president elect since the advent of polling   gallup find trump will take office with a    percent approval rating   quinnipiac peg at    percent   at this point in    obama  s approval rating be    percent   bush  s approval rating be    percent   and clinton  s approval rating be    percent     this be the downside of govern through division   limit the number of people who can see as part of coalition   and make the opposition loathe even more   as write this   there be tear gas on the street of washington   dc   as police try to disperse protester from the path of trump  s    parade     obama and the democrats waste a lot of time search for republican support never get   and make a number of unwise substantive compromise along the way     obamacare   for instance   sit in the senate for month as max baucus seek republican support   and the subsidy be thin        and thus the premium be high        because democrats be try to keep cost down to appeal to republicans and moderate   in the end   get no republican support   and many be frustrated with obamacare  s high deductible and premium        trump and the republicans look unlikely to worry about attract democratic support   but also look unlikely to try to build majority support for political agenda        a strategy that come with own   potentially severe   cost     the split here may not just be democrat versus republican   may be trump versus republican   inauguration address mostly ignore major conservative priority like lower taxis     possible trump intend to chart a very    path and rely on the pull of party polarization to sweep congressional majority along   if republicans could not stop from do and say what want during the primary     not at all clear have the backbone or even the political capital to do now that   president                 the price of all this division be   well   division   be unknown if trump can hold together a govern majority with such low approval number   so little interest in conciliatory rhetoric or legislation   and such an angry   activate opposition   may prove to be the president who convince the democratic coalition that vote in midterm election really be important        and if so   will have do the republican party terrible   last damage   usually   the strategy of break the country in half be pursue by coalition certain represent the big half   in this case     be try by the coalition represent the small   albeit geographically more efficient   half     but this be the experiment begin today   obamaism be dead   welcome to trumpism

hold a sign that read     not fit   not worthy   not legitimate     ask why consider incoming president donald trump illegitimate     be influence and aid by a foreign government     tell   a few block away   amy kellash have a much different perspective on the trump inauguration   would travel with family from gilman   minnesota   for   trump  s victory   mean end the corruption of the previous administration and politician in general       do not specify what corruption be refer to   but that be not the point   trump win   clinton lose   and that mean   hope for and child         the difference between protester and attendee be hard to miss   the protester be young   diverse   casually dress in dark color   the attendee be largely white   old   and formally dress   and view   like queeney and kellash  s   represent the deep division between americans over the new president        trump win the presidency but lose the popular vote by several million vote   the presidential transition after the election do not help win over the americans who vote against   trump be extraordinarily unpopular for an incoming president   approval rating sit at    percent   as low as have see at this stage of a presidency      percent of americans already disapprove of the job   do   the majority coalition that vote against trump and the supporter who carry to the white house find no unity on inauguration day   expect the inauguration to reflect the division of the election and transition   and do   the people who vote for trump think   america  s last good hope   for everyone else   a calamity        the scene in downtown dc on inauguration day be tense      protester descend on nearly every entry point to the inauguration area   lead by a group call disruptj     the protester seek to block each of the entrance into the inauguration   and that   precisely what do     at the corner of   th and e street   northwest   perhaps the most trafficked entry point   a wave of protester push way to front of the line   dozen of protester block both sidewalk and shout at trump supporter as attempt to pass   scream     find another way     several other sit directly in front of the entryway   lock arm and force police officer to move   those who make past the barrier be greet with cry of     shame   shame   shame     as make way to the security tent   hundred more protester insert into already long line   hope to clog thing up                 for the most part   attendee do a good job of ignore the provocation   a few skirmish between protester block the entrance and trump supporter try to get through   but nothing erupt into    violence   other knock over trash can and move barrier gate around to confuse attendee       later   there be report of protester vandalize property and clash with police   the associated press report that   police give chase to a group of about     protester who smash the window of downtown business include a starbucks   bank of america and mcdonald  s as denounce capitalism and trump     the goal of the protest be disruption     call on all people of good conscience to join in disrupt the ceremony     a statement read on disruptj    s website       if trump be to be inaugurate at all   let happen behind closed door   show the true face of the security state trump will preside over   must be make clear to the whole world that the vast majority of people in the united states do not support presidency or consent to rule     law enforcement clumsily manage the situation   physically break the human chain in order to let people by   but the chain quickly reform   and the stalemate resume   and so go for most of the morning   eventually police deploy tear gas and smoke bomb to disperse the crowd                notice a group of woman hold two massive banner that read   illegitimate   and   not president     make the trip here from chicago        one of   a woman name val jones   echo a sentiment hear over and over again   the election   say     be devastating        think there   something desperately wrong with this election   think most of america feel cheat and know this be not a legitimate election        be disappointed that could not stand up as a country against this threat   but be here today to do just that     ask val  s partner   sharon jones   what think about the strategy of disruption   be not entirely comfortable with   but   like many of the people in the street today   see in the trump administration an existential threat       what have with trump and cabinet     tell     be fascist who would undermine right in order to serve the   percent        this be a democracy   and have to fight back   have to send a message                 trump supporter be less distraught than the protester   but guy win   ask the same two question ask many of the protester   what do trump  s victory mean to   and what kind of country should be   answer echo trump  s stump speech     helen matuz   a woman from long island   tell vote from trump because   gong to   build up military and make america great again       ann kellash   amy  s sister     say believe trump   will straighten everything out and run the country like a business       need change     add     and that   what trump be     change   as ever   be the key word here               some will say the protest today go too far   that block gate be counterproductive   perhaps   but protest be about disruption   and so in that sense what happen today be not        apart from the act of vandalism        unusual or extreme   a point be make       as for whether or not any of this be likely to make thing well   the answer be probably not   no one  s in the business of persuasion anymore   as vox  s andrew prokop note   trump make little effort in inaugural address to reach out to people who do not vote for   choose instead to double down on vaguely ethnonationalist campaign rhetoric     what will be interesting to watch be how trump voter respond to what will presumably be a host of fail promise   trump run an aggressively populist campaign   million of white    americans be expect economic deliverance   but the reality be that trump  s plan will likely be a nightmare for many of these americans     before the inauguration ceremony be over   trump  s new whitehouse   gov website go live   on be a series of traditional     and libertarian policy   which   if enact   will devastate    and    americans     vox  s dylan matthews examine the proposal in detail here     if trump fail to bring back job   if slash taxis for the top   percent   if gut the regulatory framework or undercut social welfare program or strip million of americans of health coverage      peoplewill suffer immensely   trump and the republicans will have to own   and the talk point will not suffice   what notice today talk to trump supporter and protester be that everyone tend to want the same thing        well job   more opportunity   equity   ask amy kellash   the trump supporter from minnesota   what kind of country america should   answer be     free     ask queeney   the trump protester from florida   the same question   answer be     free

but while the press have occasionally congratulate for be willing to call out trump for misstatement or debate at what point make sense to assert that any particular misstatement be a   lie     most

not care if call out on     just two month ago   pay      million in damage to make fraud lawsuit relate to trump university go away          what be deal with here friend     florida sen  marco rubio

tellingly   have pointedly never apologize or retract that claim   simply decide that once trump have become the republican party nominee that what want to do be support the republican party nominee  s presidential campaign   even though the nominee be a con artist who spend entire career stick to the little guy     rubio  s reasoning   which have be follow by all of colleague in the congressional gop   be that at the end of the day   a trump administration will advance traditional republican party policy priority   the american conservative movement have some popular idea   but bedrock economic policy idea of massive tax cut for wealthy household be not popular   why not a con man to sell   trump  s policy agenda be more conventional than speech on the level of rhetoric   trump  s inaugural address be a stark departure from the free market theme that have characterize other    republicans   reach back to some of the    law and order rhetoric of the nixon year   offer a small dab of religiosity   hark way back to gop isolationist of the     s   and then poach a fair amount of     rhetoric from the populist wing of the democratic party     at the same time   trump  s team roll out the new whitehouse   gov website   which include a bit of a description of trump  s economic plan       start with    tax reform to help american worker and business keep more of    dollar

goldman sachs alumnus   what   propose   as good as can tell   be a return to george w  bush  s economic policy overlay with a dollop of new tariff        watch what trump do   not what say good guess be that trumpian governance will end up look more like the boilerplate conservative policy currently populate the white house website than like the feisty populism of the inaugural address     possible   of course   that will be wrong   like everyone else know who cover politic   have have the chance to be wrong about a lot over the past two year     but the fact remain that to an unusual extent for a politician   what trump say be a poor guide to what will do     thousand of people believe that trump university would not claim trump be    instructor unless be   in fact      instructor   on the one hand   probably think a successful businessman would value a reputation as a man of word   on the other hand   may have believe the legal system would protect from fraudulent claim   in reality   trump routinely stiff contractor who work for and wind up pay out an enormous fraud settlement over the university     every politician have ever hear of sometimes say thing that be not true   no politician that be familiar with have such an extensive background of fundamentally misrepresent as trump do     the watchword for cover the trump era ought to be watch what do   not what say     the trump show be a macabre   fascinating   appalling   thrilling spectacle   but as far as know   relationship to the trump administration be tenuous and ambiguous   the show be a show   the administration will impact the life of hundred of million of people      watch     on america  s institution to check trump

donald trump have suspend the rule of politic   be not suppose to win   and do win   so who   to say what hurt and what do not        there   something to be say for that view   trump  s political success have certainly defy expectation   but the idea of teflon trump be belie by the evidence   trump be a historically unpopular figure who receive few vote than opponent   take office with the low approval rating of any    on record   the surprise of victory have overwhelm the strangeness of circumstance and the weak foundation upon which rest        and trump  s job be about to get much hard   great advantage as a candidate be that have no real record in politic   have no vote to defend or result to explain away   in that environment   may expect trump  s comment to be take more seriously   but the opposite happen   trump  s evident ignorance of policy topic   and tendency to frequently contradict   raise question about whether believe   or even understand   what be say   as vox  s dave

who vote for trump and feel comfortable dismiss promise to repeal the law     but that end now   the presidency be a job of specific   specific legislation that either sign or veto   specific executive order that lie out intention in clear language   specific nominee whose background and action reflect back on boss   and specific result that voter hold accountable for        trump begin a nearly impossible job in a historically weak position   be about to develop a record that can not escape and can not deny   matter greatly whether and congressional republicans do a good job   and be not obvious   at least to   that realize     a cabinet at war with on thursday   the day before trump  s inauguration   rick perry   the former governor of texas   appear before the senate committee on energy and resources   perry be there to win confirmation as trump  s first secretary of energy   and come with an agenda in mind       be a big believer that have role to play in applied r d and technology commercialization     perry say   tout the government  s history help to develop the technology that kick off the hydraulic fracking boom   say want to increase research into advanced supercomputing   boast of own work in texas invest in solar energy research                but shortly before perry  s hearing begin   the hill report that trump  s transition team be preppe the administration  s first budget        and include massive cut to the department of energy   quickly become clear that no one have brief perry on the administration  s plan   what happen next   as vox  s brad plumer recount   be excruciating     sen  debbie stabenow     ask perry whether would go along with eliminate the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy   which focus on research around wind   solar   efficiency   or the office of fossil energy   which be crucial for develop carbon capture technology for coal     try to shrug off   say     just because see something on the internet do not mean   true     when press   perry meekly add that would try to advocate for these agency     but may not be         percent successful     a few minute later   sen  mazie hirono     bring up the cut again   say       hard to see how can pursue an          energy   strategy if so much of the department  s capability be eliminate   do support these cut   yes or no     perry make another awkward joke without really answer     well   senator   maybe will have the same experience have and forget that say that          two day before perry   embarrassing hearing   betsy devos

conservative politic as a billionaire donor   not a policy expert or successful public official        have few qualification for the role   and evince little knowledge of key debate in education   ask an obvious question by sen  al franken about whether think school should be measure on the progress student make or the absolute amount know   appear completely unfamiliar with the debate   and be not able even to parse the question   at another point   suggest gun may be need in school to defend against bear                senate republicans seem forewarn that devos be unprepared for the hearing   schedule the discussion   unusually   for   pm   and limit each senator to a single question   this perhaps protect devos from further embarrassment   but as matt yglesias write   be hard to see how that actually help the trump administration   at the end of the day   there be go to be an education secretary   and that person be go to be a member of trump  s administration     in the republican party  s interest   more than anyone else   that that person be an effective member of the team   shield devos  s flaw from public scrutiny by schedule an unusually brief hearing with limited question at an odd time work well if goal be to spare embarrassment        but the gop be only sabotage by allow trump to draft this    roster   the president can not be everywhere simultaneously        an effective cabinet be how extend reach   influence more people   and get more do     over the weekend   trump give an interview to two of europe  s big newspaper in which call nato   obsolete     predict the european union would fall apart and say the united states would be perfectly happy to see happen   and threaten a trade war with germany over bmw locate a plant in mexico   meanwhile   strike a conciliatory note on russia   suggest would be happy to lift sanction   if can strike a few good deal with russia       as zack beauchamp write     trump  s stated policy idea   if implement   would have the effect of accomplish much of what putin have dream of but that the russian leader may have never have think possible     this be   to put lightly   not the foreign policy that trump  s various cabinet nominee have outline   defense secretary   gen  james mattis   ace hearing by throw trump under the bus          the most important thing be that recognize the reality of what deal with mr  putin   and recognize that be try to break the north atlantic treaty organization     mattis say   go on to call nato   the most successful alliance in modern history   and maybe ever     contradict trump on the iran nuclear deal   which support leave in place   and on move israel  s capital to jerusalem     the story be similar with other nominee   nikki haley   trump  s propose united nations ambassador   take a hard line on russia   and criticize trump for attack on german chancellor angela merkel   trump  s candidate for secretary of state   rex tillerson   try to sidestep the whole situation by claim and trump have never even talk about russia                 and this be only count the part of trump  s administration that be be staff   the new york times note that trump have name only    of the     executive branch appointment need to make     a pace far slow than recent predecessor       healthy and appropriate for administration to contain differing opinion   but the trump administration look   at inception   like an administration at war with   and with boss   do not appear to be properly vet candidate for senior post   prepare for hearing   or brief on key plan   be move slowly to identify candidate   and will take office badly understaffed give the scale of trump  s ambition   no one know who trump will listen to   what will tweet   or even what really believe   this be a recipe for paralysis at good and disaster at bad     a president who believe what want to believe most of donald trump  s tweet deserve much less attention than get   but there be one send out this week that should have be take much more seriously than be       the same people who do the phony election poll   and be so wrong   be now do approval rating poll   be rig just like before        donald j  trump    realdonaldtrump   january               come in response to trump  s poll number   which be miserable and get even bad   gallup find trump will take office with a    percent approval rating   quinnipiac peg at    percent   at this point in    obama  s approval rating be    percent   bush  s approval rating be    percent   and clinton  s approval rating be    percent   the number be stark enough that trump feel compel to respond          the same people who do the phony election poll   and be so wrong   be now do approval rating poll     tweet     be rig just like before     there be so much trump have claim to be rig        the medium   the election   the emmys   the electoral college   chemistry test        that   easy to ignore this kind of rhetoric   but there be little reason to doubt trump believe   if have just win the election in defiance of all poll   would not               there be little reason to believe the poll be wrong   however   first   the national poll be not far off in the election        predict hillary clinton would win the popular vote   and do   albeit by a few percentage point less than project   but more to the point   what throw off the election poll be an incorrect model of who would actually turn out to vote        those poll   after all   have to distinguish people who will cast a ballot from those who will not   favorability poll do not   just ask anyone who be an adult   or anyone who be a register voter   what think     but this fit trump  s tendency to believe what want to believe        a characteristic that often lead into strange territory than doubt opinion poll   trump be an enthusiastic conspiracy theorist who will believe almost anything so long as flatter view of the world   obama be bear in kenya   muslims in new jersey cheer the fall of the twin towers   climate change be a hoax invent by the chinese   vaccine cause autism   the clintons perhaps murder vince foster   obama be a secret muslim   antonin scalia be assassinate   and on and on and on                one of the danger of the presidency be that   easy for anyone who control nuclear weapon to insulate from hard truth and unpleasant critique   but good decision require good information   president often have to hear thing do not want to hear        that an idea be not good   that a plan have become unworkable   that a policy do not add up   that a trust subordinate be underperform   that a strategy will not survive public or judicial scrutiny   trump   by contrast   hear what want to hear   this be why disregard of polling be so unnerving   republicans control the house   the senate   the supreme court   and most governorship   the only real check on trump  s behavior be public opinion   but if adopt the viewpoint that poll show unpopular must   by definition   be wrong     hard to see how will be able to check own instinct   as dylan matthews write       if trump do dismiss these number   that mean   ignore one of the only thing that can hold back   instead of take poll as indicator        imperfect indicator   but still        that something be go wrong and may want to pivot for own good   may not consider at all   if abuse the pardon power and favorability plummet   will not notice   if repeal obamacare without replace and the country rebel   will not believe that americans view that as a mistake   successful presidency be not build atop     successful policy be not design by ignore inconvenient fact   and if nothing else   trump will learn be hard to hold congress in line once have become politically toxic   the difference between trump and reagan the optimistic view of trump be that be the second coming of ronald reagan        another politician deride as a celebrity ideologue but who remade american politic for a generation                but reagan be the    governor of california when be elect president   have spend year marinate in conservative idea and learn how to put into practice   understand the institution need to work through and the politician need to partner with   be a voracious reader who take what read seriously   and routinely compromise with reality   enter office with a    percent approval rating   and cultivate an optimistic   friendly political tone mean to allay fear of presidency     this be not to whitewash reagan  s record   or even to dismiss the difficulty of the job undertake   two year after be elect   reagan  s approval rating have dip into the low    and democrats see massive win in the midterm election   the late washington post columnist david broder declare reaganism   a    phenomenon   and compliment the man   work together to fill the vacuum of leadership that reagan  s phaseout have leave     two year after that   reagan be reelect in a landslide   election be the beginning of story   not the end of   the hope and change barack obama  s supporter feel in      be much diminish by        and have curdle into something grimmer and more ironic by        the uncertainty george w  bush  s backer feel after the      election have become elation by      and devastation by             what drive the story   once a new president take office   be reality   what change for reagan between      and      be the state of the economy   what change for bush between      and      be the grind disaster of the iraq war   what change for obama between      and      be that the high hope of election give way to the reality of    percent unemployment and bitter polarization   and what change between      and      be the beginning of economic recovery     in a way few appreciate   trump have the right experience for the job of presidential candidate   be a reality television star at a time when cable network and social medium have turn election into a reality television show   know how to hold the camera   play the medium   and thrill the crowd   understand how to make people laugh and how to make hate   realize be well to have some people love than a lot of people merely like                 but the job of president be different from the job of candidate        and in some way   be the opposite of the way trump run candidacy   trump run on grand promise   toward the end of the campaign   take to tell rally that vote for be last chance to

130195,195824,Barack Obama was the perfect pop culture president — for better or worse,Vox,Todd

seem presidential   make a law professor   and will seem professorial   in some other universe   there   probably some alternate version of obama who become a novelist and be widely regard as one of america  s foremost man of letter     this be not to say obama be multitalente        though be        but rather that boast the    ability to make seem like a natural fit for wherever end up   be sure some of that skill can be attribute to dna and upbringing   a biracial child be raise by white grandparent       make that argument in both of memoir     but just as much have to do with confident   observational demeanor   obama be great at hang back   then deliver exactly the right quip at exactly the right moment     easy to imagine as the guy at the edge of the room   offer trenchant commentary about everybody dance at center   belong everywhere and nowhere all at once   and that can be disarm       as obama tell the atlantic  s    coate of day on the campaign trail       if walk into a room and   a bunch of white farmer   trade unionist   middle age        be not walk in thinking   man   have get to show that be normal   walk in there   think   with a set of assumption   like   these people look just like grandparent   and see the same jell o mold that grandmother serve   and have get the same   know   little stuff on mantelpiece   and so be maybe disarm by just assume that be okay   this make obama a pop culture president unlike any other   bill clinton be know for turn considerable charm on anybody meet        talk show host and voting citizen alike   meanwhile   george w  bush often seem like something of an awkward uncle   laugh at people  s joke but not get       but obama be as comfortable on fox news as be on the daily show or read mean tweet on kimmel   could play game with jimmy fallon or talk policy with journalist   and act demonstrably different with both   often seem like truly understand pop culture   particularly    and prestige tv   the two most dominant cultural form of era   be like choose a persona for each occasion        goofy but proud dad   cool guy   serious wonk        and then step into     in this way   as in so many other   the man who be replace be exact opposite   barack obama wear many hat   but donald trump be always donald trump   for well or bad   obama be roundly praise for pop culture acuman   but be that acuman as useful as be assume to be   may seem hard to believe now   but when obama appear on jay leno  s tonight show early in presidency in        be the first ever appearance from a sit president on a    talk show   and follow up with appearance on every major    show that air during administration   throw in michelle obama  s appearance on a host of other program   and the obamas   casual domination of pop culture seem either calculated or effortless depend on the color of the lense choose to wear     do not hurt that both half of the couple be    joke teller   a skill that few president or first lady possess                  be speak as if obama purposefully lean into whatever tv show be appear on   even the news   but that   not strictly accurate   sure   choose which mode and tone to use in each situation   but always have a certain sense of gravity to   even when be    the news   obama  s strength be in find a way to move toward the center of the pop culture solar system but also pull toward   so meet in the middle   instead of awkwardly wave at each other across a wide gap       obama also curate the pop culture consume in a way that make seem populist but still pretty cool   watch homeland when be new and buzzworthy   and be the only person in the world to receive game of thrones season six screener from hbo before the episode air on television   like hamilton before be cool   where ronald reagan have regularly host film screening at the white house to swell of publicity   fit for a former film actor and screen actors guild president   obama seem to understand that cultural moment coincide with a cultural moment for    and prestige television        and adjust view pattern and guest list accordingly     do not mean to sound cynical   obama have be perform this sort of softshoe whole political life     why rarely say something truly incendiary   but also why supporter so often wish would   to be obama        to be black   but also have white heritage   but also participate in power structure still primarily design for white man        be to tread carefully to a fault   possess immense power but often carry as an outsider   which be basically a description for every    ever   hollywood respond in kind   provide with copious public support while also give some americans the sense that obama be increasingly   out of touch   or do not understand the plight of those who do not regularly pal around with beyonc  or    miranda                  have always bristle at the idea that obama  s pop culture savvy be genius   or central to appeal   or something similar   think may be central to appeal to most fervent supporter   indeed   have love a great many of tv appearance   but have also often wonder if work against   chip away at some of what make relatable       look at other president when would intersect with pop culture   and can see the flop sweat   clinton be well at than bush   but only in the sense that there be something weirdly charming about clinton when be try too hard   watch famous      appearance on the arsenio hall show   and can see how much effort   invest to make everybody love     whenever bush cross over into pop culture   usually seem like be terrify may forget line     obama never let see any uncertainty   and when consider that primary outreach to the average american        especially in second term        have come from appearance on tv show   the picture become more complicated     in        obama run on a campaign of understand people  s pain   if maybe not feel   and wife have just pay off student loan a few year prior   shop at target   be not like and anymore        would be hard for a us senator to not become part of the system        but be close enough to those day to remember   trace obama  s pop culture encounter throughout two term   however   and see a guy who increasingly seem almost more at home amid the laughter and light of the hollywood stage   mind   do not think that   literally true        obama  s talent   again   be make think   comfortable in pretty much any situation   but if be a very particular sort of voter   one who think the   coastal elite   have forget about the little guy   obama   looseness on late night play into a very old   very persistent criticism   one from the early day of political career     donald trump be a pop culture wrecking ball   that make easy to relate to     one of the right  s most persistent slur against obama during the      election cycle be that be run solely for own ego   to become famous   as if the campaign have not already make famous       to many on the left   this suggestion seem ridiculous   obama clearly have a whole platform want to enact   but level of fame and celebrity        and celebrity support        cause many on the right to see obama as a vacuum   come to stand for essentially any policy or program could think of that disagree with   to the point that when obama  s plan be inevitably more moderate or even    than expect   almost do not matter   the person sell be a symbol of a coastal elitism fear would leave behind     should note here that obama  s race also play a role   though will come back to that                  the cottage industry of easily disprove rumor that spring up around the obamas   like one declare michelle obama to be a trans woman   make more sense in this context   yes   the right have do something similar to the clintons by   say   suggest have murder former deputy white house counsel vince foster   but the clinton family  s seem hatred of the press and transparency provide fertile soil for rumor   paradoxically   because the obamas   frequent tv appearance make seem more open        but also like character on a show        even the most ridiculous rumor could take root        to be sure   much of this be because obama be black   and thus an unusual or even threatening figure to some   but obama be also hollywood   and that status bring with an additional set of cultural assumption and signifier   hollywood be a place of empty vacuousness and deep debauchery   be the last place a president should seem so cozy in       ironic that for as much as conservative lament the left  s suppose love of celebrity   the two president who have actual show business background be both republicans   ronald reagan and donald trump   this strike many on the left   include   as bizarre        a kind of projection onto the left of the thing many on the right apparently want   a celebrity president     but look at trump  s rise actually explain why this sort of candidate be so compelling to republican voter   contrast any random trump    appearance from throughout decade of celebrity with any random obama    appearance   obama gently take control of the show   while trump just seem a little desperate to be like   to fit in   showbiz be never trump  s natural home   but wish could be   that desire to be like mean host could mock endlessly and would take                here   david letterman   speak to the new york times   have know donald trump for a long time and always think be exactly what new york city need to have   the big   blowhard billionaire     by god   be donald trump and date model and put up building   and everything be gold     nobody take seriously   and people love when would come on the show   would make fun of hair   would call a slumlord   would make fun of tie   and could just take a punch like nothing   be the perfect guest       with that quote in mind   watch obama  s      white house correspondents   association dinner evisceration of trump  s pursuit of obama  s     birth certificate     trump laugh along   but can visibly see   even from very far away   how uncomfortable be   even obama  s milder zinger be clearly rattle     trump be happy to be humiliate   but usually only on term     see also   the list of topic that be off limit for comedy central roast     now be be mock when do not expect to be   and savagely so   if can put in trump  s shoe   even for a second     easy to understand just how supporter gravitate toward as an exemplar of many grievance   of the way the world seem less attuned to than ever before      in a way   trump and obama  s tv persona perfectly exemplify approach to politic   obama use wit as a tool   can take   and dish out   and that make feel at home   but above all   have to keep smile   a lifetime of be a black man in america have make understand that   if nothing else   can only commandeer the stage if do not seem too threatening     trump   however   be a boulder   can land punch after punch after punch on   and nothing will happen   until abruptly roll forward a couple of second later and crush   donald trump have be the butt of the joke        from    comedian   from regular people   from president even        for decade now   and even after an election win     spend an inordinate amount of time on twitter try to get people to stop make fun of   maybe all those year of grin and bear snipe and snide remark be preparation for roll forward   just a few inch                no matter what situation   in   trump will never be talente enough to tell joke or keep cool during interview or spar with the host   but   somehow more interesting for that   because keep try     see emily nussbaum for more on trump  s    delivery       always be a very rich white man in a country that bend to the whim of very rich white man   why appear on tv at all   because like the attention   if be to zero in on trump  s achille   heel   would be that need love   and especially need love if be famous people   drive a little nuts when can not get   there   a reason rarely pass up a medium opportunity in the early day

there       what do want       what   goal          if there   a protest or demonstration   can count on an observer ask these question from the sideline   and   to be fair   the answer be less than obvious when ten of thousand of diverse people have gather   with sign   chant   and group membership that cover a wide range of issue   that   already be the case for the women  s march on washington   take place in washington   dc   on saturday     be project that this event could draw more attendee than president donald trump  s friday inauguration and have inspire satellite marche take place across the country and around the world   on friday   planeload of woman   many toting sign or wear   pussy hat     mean to recall        and reclaim        the infamous    reference in trump  s tape brag about be able to grab woman by genital without consent   flood into the nation  s capital in preparation for the festivity        the mainstream understanding of the event be that   a protest against trump   and the woman participate have plenty to complain about        from admit sexual misconduct to the many sexual assault allegation against that   deny to the serious threat to woman  s health and reproductive right that expert expect base on threaten defunding of planned parenthood and appointment of conservative supreme court justice        but organizer say something slightly different   create the event to send an affirmative message that   woman  s right be human right     that   why call a   march   or a   rally   instead of a protest   perhaps that   split hair   but   undeniable that a lot more thought than   trump be bad   go into the planning        and that characterize only as a protest against somewhat flatten the message that many participant hope to send   here   what need to know to understand why organizer create the march   and why so many woman   and man   will be there   there   no guesswork about the goal   the women  s march have an official platform the simple   official answer to   what do want     be easy to find in the first paragraph of the march  s official policy platform   a    document title   guide vision and defining principals   that be release in advance of the event   note that aim to bring together people of all gender and background   the organizer proclaim goal be   to affirm share humanity and pronounce bold message of resistance and           what that mean   exactly   be further illuminate by the rest of the lengthy statement of principle include in the platform     much broad and more aspirational than the simple list of demand that accompany some protest and include many thing   freedom from sexual violence   for example   that could not be realistically achieve right away   even by a progressive   feminist administration     while many of the point be aspirational   many other be accompany by incremental goal and specific action that would be necessary to achieve   among other thing   the march  s statement of principle call for       accountability and justice for police brutality   and     dismantle   the gender and racial inequity within the criminal justice system   freedom from sexual violence ratify the equal rights amendment to the constitution that would guarantee equal protection base on gender affirming that all domestic and caretake work be work   even if unpaid   and that woman        especially woman of color        bear the brunt of that burden   the right to organize and fight for a live minimum wage   for all worker   labor protection for undocumented and migrant worker   and   solidarity with sex worker   right movement   comprehensive reproductive right   lgbtq right   and immigrant and refugee right   in term of symbolic goal   organizer also announce the event as a tribute to people live and dead   whom recognize as have fight for the freedom of woman   the woman be   bella abzug   corazon aquino   ella baker grace lee boggs   berta c ceres   rachel

ten of thousand of woman participate will not create a feminist mind meld        priority and belief vary go without say that not all of the people attend the march want the very same thing that the woman who write the platform have articulate as priority   while   safe to guess many of the people who show up in dc saturday would enthusiastically sign off on the entire platform   there be surely other who care primarily about one or two of element   other who disagree with some   and other who have not see and simply feel moved to gather with other woman in a very general demand for respect     but   safe to say that nearly all of demonstrate support for woman  s right        however define        in a way that provide a contrast to the attitude express by donald trump and the policy that be expect from administration     as emily crockett have write for vox   change over the language in the platform in recent week highlight that not everyone who may be motivate to participate in a movement for   woman  s rights   think about   prioritizes   or describe these right the same way   report just last week on tweak to the platform and list of participant that reflect this diversity      give that group like naral and planned parenthood be sponsor the march     not surprising that the platform call for   reproductive freedom          define in part as   open access to safe   legal   affordable abortion and birth control for all people   regardless of income   location or education     but some    woman be just as disgust by trump  s comment as    woman   as emma green report for the atlantic        and some of be struggle to find place in the women  s march   some    woman plan to join the explicitly    march because agree with other principle   other plan to actively protest the march  s    message   one    group   new wave feminists   be actually list as a partner organization in the march for a while   but after the group  s inclusion be notice by abortion right supporter and cause controversy   organizer remove new wave feminists from the list of partner and say the group  s inclusion have be an error     a reminder that not everyone who    as   feminist   support legal abortion        and that many abortion right supporter see the term     feminist   as an oxymoron   since outlaw abortion tend to seriously hurt woman  s health and limit autonomy   the language about solidarity with sex worker be also change twice on tuesday        which expose another feminist rift and cause some brief controversy   first   the phrase   sex worker   right movement   be delete and replace with   all those exploit for sex and labor     many advocate for sex worker object to that change   since could be read as a suggestion that all sex worker be inherently or equally   exploit       those be great example of the many thing that can potentially divide people who generally want to march for woman  s right   and there be debate   too   like one over the fact that hillary clinton be not include among the list of honoree   while some of have be resolve   total agreement in a group as large and diverse as the one that   expect would be unreasonable to expect     one clear goal be to create a feminist movement that include woman of all background together   much of the discussion around the march have center on whether live up to the ideal of intersectionality   as brittney cooper   an assistant professor of woman  s and gender study and africana study at rutgers university   explain     intersectionality simply mean that there be lot of different part to womanhood      and those part        race   gender   sexuality   and religion   and ability        be not incidental or auxiliary   matter politically         as crockett have report   all the original organizer of the march be white   which raise question about whether the march would take the concern of woman of color into account   after that   though   three prominent woman of color who be experienced activist and organizer join bob bland   one of the first woman to organize the march on social medium   as national    of the event   tamika d  mallory   carmen perez   and linda sarsour   together   the three lead a march from new york city to washington   dc   in      to demand change in america  s criminal justice system   the official platform of the women  s march place the demonstration in the context of not only suffragist and abolitionist but also the civil right movement   the american indian movement   and black live matter   just two paragraph into the    document   organizer note that   woman have intersect identity and be therefore impact by a multitude of social justice and human right issue     example of this   include the especially urgent need for equal pay among woman of color and the way be uniquely victimize by the criminal justice system   follow in the rest of the platform   some woman reportedly drop out of the march because be not comfortable with the conversation around this topic on the march  s facebook page   but   a sign of the organizer   commitment to inclusiveness that shrug off these concern       this be an opportunity to take the conversation to the deep place     sarsour   a muslim who head the arab american association of new york   tell the new york times     sometimes be go to upset people       if    goal be to get as many people as possible at the march   maybe do not want to alienate people     anne valk   the author of radical sisters   say in the same article     but if    goal be to use the march as a catalyst for progressive social and political change   then that have to include think about race and class privilege     the event be more than a protest against trump the platform do not even mention the new president  s name   still   as crockett   have write   the connection to win        and the apparent validation of the thing stand for        be clear        many woman be dismay or even horrify that america choose trump        an alleged sexual predator whose policy could be a huge setback for woman  s health and right        over clinton   a highly qualified public servant who could have be america  s first woman president   this gender dynamic have become such a powerful motivator that the women  s march will probably become the large inauguration weekend gathering of people who oppose trump     there   good reason to believe that negative reaction to   grab by the pussy   remark specifically fuel some of the energy behind this march   that   especially true when consider the result of a    survey by perryundem   a nonpartisan public opinion research firm   on general attitude about gender equality and how americans feel about specific gender issue surround the      election   the result indicate that many americans may have be motivate specifically by the leak tape to become politically active in support of woman  s right        and clearly   the march provide an opportunity to do just that   crockett explain     one of the poll  s many strike finding be this   while may not have lose trump the election in the end   the leaked      access hollywood tape that feature trump brag about ability to sexually assault woman        specifically   that could   grab   woman   by the pussy     kiss without consent   and do whatever want to because   a star        have a major impact on many americans   and have not be forget   most americans survey      percent   remember hear about the tape   almost all of those survey      percent   say find trump  s comment   unacceptable     and most      percent overall      percent of woman   and    percent of man   say feel   upset   by the comment      be   upset   about the trump tape be the most reliable predictor of how likely someone be to take political action as a direct result of trump  s election   the second most reliable predictor of take political action be the belief that the country would be well off with more woman in political office   no other factor   include party affiliation   be significantly correlate with take political action   even after rule out how people feel about trump  s comment on that tape   a respondent  s general feeling about trump   whether favorable or not   do not correlate with political action either     that   why will see pink knit   pussy hat   and plenty of    signage saturday   but the answer to   what do want     be big than   to get together and say the president be bad       the large goal seem to be to harness the energy around this particular moment to launch a robust   feminist activist community to fight the gender inequality and assault on woman  s right and dignity        which of course   exist long before donald trump come to power      watch   meet the women  s march on washington

any legislation want to push will have to move through congress first       but trump will nonetheless be able to significantly change the country and the white house pretty much immediately upon take office   here be just a few hint as to how       what trump can do by executive order since trump become the presumptive republican nominee last spring   a team of adviser head up by the heritage foundation  s stephen moore have be work on what call the   first day project         want to identify maybe    executive order that trump could sign literally the first day in office     moore tell the new yorker  s evan osnos back in september       trump have specifically promise some   day one   initiative   and transition source have give reporter some more detail on which be likely on deck   here be a few to expect   immigration   this be perhaps the area where trump and team have be most specific   likely move include an executive order   to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with mexico     and suspend the syrian refugee admission program   trump have promise to rescind daca   obama  s executive order protect more than           undocumented immigrant who arrive as child   accord to reuters     be unlikely trump  s order will result in an immediate    of these immigrant             rather   be expect to let the authorization expire       the program issue    authorization let beneficiary work and attend school     how exactly this will work may take a while to sort out        for one thing   have implication for state driver  s license        delay formal action by trump       dapa   a similar program for undocumented parent of us citizen   have not take effect yet due to court action   will likely be rescind   or the administration may simply fail to defend in court   trump have tell reporter   interested in implement   muslim ban          since retool into a ban on immigration from     region where vetting can not safely occur     and   extreme vetting   for all other        through an executive action   as soon as monday   but like daca   this be an area where the specific be up in the air   which could delay an order   trade   along with immigration   this be the point that trump  s team have be clear on   in october   trump promise to use first day in office to withdraw from the    partnership trade deal with asian and other pacific nation   and to withdraw from or renegotiate the nafta deal with canada and mexico   but executive action on trade likely will not stop there   have say will instruct the treasury department to label china a currency manipulator        an action that do not do a lot on own but that enable the administration to levy retaliatory tariff against the country   which would then either be subject to world trade organization arbitration or spur yet more tariff from china   spark the beginning of a trade war   the transition have state that wilbur ross   the secretary of commerce nominee   will be the administration  s point person on trade issue   which make sense give that the department of commerce have a lot of discretion in set tariff   in the october speech   trump promise that upon take office would   direct the secretary of commerce and u  s  trade representative to identify all foreign trading abuse that unfairly impact american worker and direct to use every tool under american and international law to end those abuse immediately     those tool be real   and powerful   the tariff act of        also know   infamously   as the    act   be still on the book   though tariff have be massively reduce   and give the commerce secretary the authority to impose   countervail duty   against country offer subsidy to export and     duty against country flood the market with cheap good       some of these vehicle will take a while to be use   but every indication be that trump and administration intend to use shortly after take office   environment   the    environmental executive action of the obama area        include the clean power plan and other greenhouse gas regulation        be certainly in danger in the trump era   but will take a while to attack   environmental protection agency rule that have already be finalize   like the clean power plan   require a lengthy review and rulemake process to change   as harvard  s jody freeman explain to vox  s brad plumer last month   on day one   the epa could ask the dc circuit court   which be review the clean power plan   for a   voluntary remand     which would send the rule back to the epa   and if the court agree   the epa could start try to replace the rule with something weak   but as freeman tell plumer     the epa would have to go out for public comment on that        and that usually take a year or two     other environmental rule could be roll back earlier   trump could reconsider obama  s decision to reject construction of the keystone xl pipeline   or declare intention to ignore the paris climate deal   something have long promise to do   though   waffle a bit after the election     there be also a bunch of    white house executive order direct agency to take various step on climate change that can be rescind on the first day   health care   while the heavy lifting of obamacare repeal will be do by congress   there   a fair bit that donald trump and administration can do on own   for example   while would require a lengthy rulemaking process similar to what the epa will have to go through   the birth control mandate under obamacare can be unilaterally reverse by the executive branch   trump could direct the irs to change enforcement priority   for example by deemphasize the employer or individual mandate or change what count as a   hardship exemption   to the individual mandate       the one health care change that be all but guarantee be the revival of the   mexico city policy     a      initiative implement by ronald reagan that prevent foreign nonprofit group get federal aid money from provide or promote abortion   even if those activity be not fund by federal dollar   the rule be customarily rescind by democratic president and reinstate by republicans   and there   no reason to believe trump will be an exception   the immediate change be not just about executive action that   just for starter   immediately upon inauguration   trump get to install white house staff   which do not need senate confirmation   that mean that as of friday   these will be official adviser in the white house      michael flynn   the retired    general who dine with vladimir putin and tweet that be rational to be afraid of muslims   steve bannon   who have spend year at the helm of breitbart mainstreame the    and oversee a site subsection for   black crime     and once refer to feminist as   fucking dyke     jared kushner   the president       whose presence be arguably a violation of federal    rule   k  t  mcfarland   who have argue that vladimir putin should receive a nobel peace prize and advocate for bomb iran   gary cohn   the goldman sachs alum who will run the national economic council   and that   leave out reince priebus   kellyanne conway   sean spicer   hope hicks   and many other white house staff already announce   beyond personnel and policy   one should not forget the effect that trump  s mere presence in the white house will have on the country   barack obama  s presence be hugely influential   not least for a generation of black youth who be the first to grow up with a president who look like   and for opponent who recoil at the idea of someone with obama  s temperament   background   and   yes   race hold office   trump   obviously   have a sharply different relationship with minority community   presence will   like obama  s   naturally cheer some part of the population and spark fear among other   those effect be real   and in a sense begin before trump even take office   the act of become the president   though   will make strong still     watch     on america  s institution to check trump

 shortly after the end of inaugural parade   president donald trump issue first executive order   instruction for the federal government to dismantle the affordable care act   to the maximum extent permit by law         the executive order be a powerful political statement about the health care law   one that direct agency to   waive   defer   grant exemption from   or delay   any taxis or penalty possibly can   the order do not give trump any new power   but do suggest that want to move quickly on dismantle major part of the health overhaul     this order do not in and of do anything tangible     say larry levitt   vice president at the kaiser family foundation     but direct federal agency to start take step to use administrative authority to unwind the aca in all sort of way   this be a signal that the trump administration be not wait for congress to start make big change       the clear statement so far of trump  s specific priority on the health care law   in recent week   trump have say want to improve health coverage for all americans   but   be vague about what that mean   this document suggest may take aim at a piece of the law long loathe by republicans   the individual mandate        in particular   the executive order direct agency to use any authority within the bound of the law to dismantle   any provision      that would impose a fiscal burden on any state   or a cost   fee   tax   penalty   or regulatory burden on an individual          the mandate require all americans to have health care coverage   and be critical to make the law work as a whole     arguable that trump could stop enforce the individual mandate without an act of congress        just as barack obama do in      with the law  s employer mandate     but this executive action on own do not unravel the mandate   or any other part of obamacare for that matter   instead   set up a long      process to change the law  s rule        an unwinding process that take time   and there be still major limit to how much trump can do before congress act         trump be go to have to comply with law   and that do not allow to repeal the affordable care act unilaterally     health law expert tim jost   a law professor at washington and lee college   say     from this perspective   as much as   a political scream     perhaps more of a practical whisper   at least for now       jost walk through two especially important thing to notice about the trump executive order           most of the paragraph in the executive order start with seven important word     to the maximum extent permit by law     these word recognize that the only action federal agency can take be those that do not conflict with the affordable care act   trump can take step to revise the rule and regulation that the obama administration write to explain how the law ought to work   for example   this executive order say that agency should try to   waive   any cost or regulatory burden on   maker of medical device   product   or medication     at first glance   this would seem like an order to repeal the health care law  s medical device tax     but trump can not do that through executive order        the medical device tax be write into the law that congress pass   may be able to tweak the tax   may be able to delay collection of the fine   for example   as the obama administration do with the employer mandate   but can not kill outright without congress       what be say here be that general policy be go to be to deregulate     jost say       say     do not want more regulation   should grant waiver where can   and give more authority to the state             trump note will follow the administrative procedure act for new rule   that   important   section   of trump  s executive order look a bit dull   but jump out at jost immediately   here   what say   to the extent that carry out the directive in this order would require revision of regulation issue through     rulemaking   the head of agency shall comply with the administrative procedure act       what this mean be that trump can not just start put out new rule and regulation tonight   instead   will have to follow the administrative procedure act   a law from      that govern the somewhat laborious process of put rule into place   this typically involve issue draft rule   accept comment   sometimes hold public hearing   and ultimately issue a final rule that take all the feedback into effect   in other word   rulemake under the administrative procedure act take time   and a lot of important obamacare regulation that govern how the law work be those that go through     rulemake the first time around   this include   for example   the rule that govern the individual mandate   take more than a year to move from the first draft of the individual mandate regulation to the final version     the trump administration have full authority to write new rule around the individual mandate        to give those without coverage more exemption   for example        but before those rule go into effect   will need to go through a similar process   jost be generally a supporter of the affordable care act   and base on these two reason outline for   this new executive order do not cause much panic       be worried   trump   would do something unpredictable   but this be what expect     say     think   be advise that can not repeal the affordable care act through executive action   and now see where this go       watch   republicans have one major problem on obamacare

seem natural and obvious for woman to be exclude from politic      but suffrage for woman represent a challenge to century of establish political thought   the central justification be the conviction that woman be by very nature unfit for political life   the political realm be inherently masculine   while the private realm of home and family be the woman  s place   the ideal of separate sphere have show remarkable endurance   as late as        the united states supreme court maintain in hoyt v  florida that state could reasonably exclude woman from jury duty because woman be   the center of home and family life   and this obligation should not be neglect       for opponent of suffrage   masculinity   rationality   and power be intrinsically link   while helplessness   sentiment   and

attitude toward woman in political life have be transform since the ratification of the   th amendment   yet in much the same way as the struggle for suffrage force opponent to articulate a rationale for exclude woman from politic   hillary clinton  s candidacy lay bare the extent to which some of the same assumption and prejudice remain powerful subtext in american life   nobody have more respect for woman than the man who do not want to vote indeed   what be once subtext become text in        what well evidence that equate political power with masculinity than a political candidate literally

nee only peruse the slogan on many    button   and bumper sticker find at trump event   the persistent expectation that woman should embody the high ethical and moral standard may help explain why action that may be consider politic as usual if perform by a man generate not just criticism   but impassione cry of   lock up     and while americans may no longer believe that woman be too weak to mark a ballot or file a brief   the possibility that a woman lack the   stamina   to fulfill the duty of the presidency can still resonate       the clinton campaign and the struggle for suffrage now

convent in the        and one be catch in the web of social medium circa        do not choose to see these three film because of inadvertent connection   but be interesting to see take on the same theme in vastly different contexts        and all from a female perspective   these three also raise an interesting question   how will audience react when the woman protagonist on screen refuse to behave as be suppose to   each film play with expectation   and if feel a little uncomfortable   be work        lady macbeth be a shocking revenge thriller in   th century scotland what a searing   jar film lady macbeth be        leave feel a little shaken       florence pugh play katherine   a young woman marry off to a man who seem to have nothing but disgust for   on wedding night   order to disrobe   look at   then turn over and go to sleep   katherine and husband live with father   and both man be severe to the extreme with katherine   force to stay indoor and submit to extreme boredom   but katherine be a rebel to the core   and husband  s and     s cruelty set a match to a big pile of kindle that   be inside all along   when both leave town   strike up a passionate affair with the new groomsman   sebastian   cosmo jarvis     and when     return and find out about the affair   coolly get rid of            rating                 the remarkable thing about lady macbeth   which be adapt by alice birch from a novella by nikolai leskov   be that refuse to allow the audience to have the emotional reaction want to have   want to root for katherine   but then turn around and act cruelly to servant   want to be on katherine and sebastian  s side   will toward happiness   but as the movie wear on   that desire sour until burst into startling   destructive flame   become clear that katherine be either something of a psychopath or a sociopath        or   at least   so bent on have way that the other human around stop have meaning and dignity on own   but there   an element of revenge fantasy   too   in how eliminate everyone who get in way   if can adjust to the idea that be not mean to sympathize with anyone   lady macbeth be quite a film                each frame of the film be gorgeously shoot   almost painterly in how render the drab home   the wild moor   and katherine  s luminous beauty   the shot be so still and quiet that grow nervous   something  s get to give   and when do        whew     visceral       lady macbeth be only william oldroyd  s first feature   but what a debut be     novitiate set a struggle for purpose in a convent during vatican ii talk about whiplash   go from a woman bent on own desire to a woman bent on give all desire up to god   novitiate   a film about nun in a strict order have to come to term with the implication of vatican ii   the reform enact in roman catholicism mean to adjust the church  s practice to a rapidly modernizing world   be almost reverential   while also lodge critique of both convent life and the reform that greatly reduce the number of those live   novitiate primarily follow cathleen   margaret qualley   who be raise by a nonreligious single mother   julianne nicholson   but end up in catholic school and   eventually   decide to enter the convent   a number of other young woman enter as well   and the film follow through time as    postulant hope to enter the order   then more serious novitiate        especially as struggle with personal fear and desire   include illicit one         rating                 the highly restrictive nature of the order suit cathleen   who crave the structure and the sense of belong to god   with concrete rule for how to grow closer to   but have a proclivity for    and extreme      starve   participate in bodily punishment   that start to surface   and the stringency of life within the wall become dangerous   write and direct by margaret betts   novitiate  s position on both the church and the reform of vatican ii seem complicated   vatican ii effectively empty out many convent around the world   as the movie state in text after the film   and the film raise the issue that woman who serve the church be not involve in the second vatican council that hand down the reform   one change vatican ii institute be proclaim that nun be equal to other faithful catholics   not more special to god   and this be devastating   especially to woman who  d devote life to the vocation   only to feel as if the church be say effort do not mean very much       the sister experience the deliberation over and creation of the reform   and especially the change those reform bring to life   not just as a slight   but as an injustice   but as see the journey of some of the novitiate and nun who leave   get a deep understanding of why woman join religious order   and why leave   novitiate capture something many religious people can understand   the idea that beat oneself   both figuratively and   sometimes   literally   as an act of devotion will make god love more than love other people                this be a complicated matter   and suspect one have to actually be catholic to get the full weight of the movie   but while novitiate be unsteady in some place     genuinely move   bolster by qualley  s and nicholson  s performance as well as melissa leo as the severe mother superior   a remarkably    character   and a host of support actress   end without resolve every question   exactly the right choice     also worth note that novitiate be one of two film about nun at this year  s sundance   the other be the irreverent comedy the little hours     last year   anne fontaine   the innocents be also set in a convent and premiere at sundance   doubt sundance have suddenly get very catholic   but the pattern be in keep with an interest in religious theme at the festival     two year ago   last day in the desert   a film about jesus   premiere here too     story about nun in convent make perfect sense in the sundance context   easily feature a large female cast and seem to be a good breeding ground for explore the variety of woman  s experience   nun dress and live in a community of uniformity   but each nun be an individual woman   with separate emotion and personality and experience   all the more interesting to explore in the confined context of a convent     ingrid goes west be a hilarious    comedy about obsession and perfection hopping ahead to the present day   ingrid go west be about an entirely different sort of woman stick in an entirely different set of stringent cultural constraint   in this case     instagram       aubrey plaza star   brilliantly   as ingrid   a woman with a serious addiction to lifestyle icon on instagram        know   the people with million of follower whose life look perfectly style and perpetually sunny and always   always flank by brunch         rating             ingrid struggle with mental health issue   especially since the death of mother   when spot the account of taylor sloane   elizabeth olsen          a blonde angeleno with a gorgeous instagram profile and an apparently perfect life   complete with dog name rothko          cash the            check inherit from mother and head for the west coast   determine to be taylor sloane  s bff   startlingly   succeed   this be not ingrid  s first rodeo   but know from the start roughly where this will end up   ingrid go west be a black comedy   and part of the joke be that be in on   even if do not literally stalk the people follow on instagram   still want life and stuff   ingrid just take one step further   try to become the kind of person who would end up in one of taylor  s instagram post        which mean buy all the right stuff   get hair lighten to the right shade   and affect the right vocal pattern   all go very badly   and watch ingrid  s pain as experience rejection be excruciating   but the route toward that point be very funny   matt spicer   who direct the film from a script    with david branson smith   remark after the film  s premiere that and smith come up with the idea after have a conversation about how much love instagram   that   obvious   the film do a great job of set up universe quickly   illustrate what   like to feel an obsession with social medium and deftly handle    technology that can sometimes feel gimmicky in less assured hand   and the film skewer the silliness of be a   social medium star   without dismiss the reason why a person may become one                that say     the impeccable comic timing of plaza and olsen that really make ingrid goes west fly   along with the outstanding o shea jackson jr  who play the aspire    enthusiast from whom ingrid rent apartment     this be a truly inspire bit of casting   which apparently happen because plaza spot jackson somewhere   realize would be great for the part   and send a dm on twitter         at time   ingrid go west remind of welcome to   a weird little film in which kristen wiig play a woman with borderline personality disorder who win the lottery and spend all on produce a surrealistic    talk show all about   ingrid go west be a little more broadly appealing        love welcome to   but the comedy be so black practically suck matter out of the room        but both ride the tricky line of play a woman  s mental health issue for both comedy and realism   which mean the character be unpredictable and still relatable   even to audience member who have not experience the same thing      all three of the film screen today be notable for a very simple thing   let woman character just be people   really flaw people who be not always understandable or likable   be use to see unlikeable man on screen   but   still a little startling to see story about woman who be unabashedly mess up   then realize those story will not simply write these woman off   and three on the same day be even well

to pay extra to reach site do not own       the president can appoint an exist fcc member chair without senate approval   accord to ryan radia   a legal expert at the competitive enterprise institute   so pai will not have to go through the confirmation process in order to assume new role   republicans will have a majority on the fcc and in congress   so there   likely nothing democrat or liberal group can do to stop republicans from roll back network neutrality rule   but   go to be a long   ugly fight that could tie up the fcc in the court for year to come       advocate say network neutrality be the foundation of an open internet when mark zuckerberg create facebook in harvard dorm room   do not need to ask comcast   verizon   or other internet service provider to add the site to network   also do not have to pay these company extra fee to ensure that facebook would work as well as the website of established company   instead   as soon as create the facebook website   be automatically available from any    computer in the world   that   the basic idea behind network neutrality   that everyone  s online content and service get treat equally online   whether   something create by a college kid or a huge medium company   advocate say network neutrality be a big reason there have be so much innovation on the internet over the past two decade   worry that without net neutrality protection   the internet would become less hospitable to new company and innovative idea   for example   if large isp begin require    site to pay extra to deliver video content to customer   the expense and hassle of negotiate deal with dozen of network owner could make difficult for the next youtube to get traction         certainly worry about reduce consumer choice     lewis say     some of the startup company that drive economic growth may not exist anymore     but opponent say that network neutrality rule be a solution in search of a problem   after all   formal network neutrality regulation be a relatively recent phenomenon   the concept do not even exist in the        and the fcc do not start try to enforce network neutrality regulation until        opponent argue that there be plenty of online innovation in the early year of the internet        before the fcc start to play net neutrality cop   so in view   repeal obama  s      open internet rule will simply remove burdensome regulation from internet service provider   without endanger the internet  s openness   pai could lead the fight to repeal network neutrality rule pai   of course   be one of those opponent   vote against the fcc  s      network neutrality rule   and issue a scathing dissent against        describe the network neutrality rule as a threat to internet freedom and argue that have undermine a bipartisan consensus against minimal regulation of the internet     the threat to internet freedom have awaken a sleeping giant     pai write     be optimistic that will look back on today  s vote as an aberration   a temporary deviation from the bipartisan path that have serve so well   do not know whether this plan will be vacate by a court   reverse by congress   or overturn by a future commission   but do believe that day be number     now appear that pai may get wish with option no       as the new fcc chair   will be able to personally lead the effort to repeal the rule       and that effort be likely to succeed   when congress last overhaul telecom law in        give the fcc broad discretion to craft telecommunications regulation   in        obama  s fcc use that discretion to significantly expand network neutrality protection without help from congress   the move be uphold by the court last year   but of course   that authority work both way   now that republican be in power   have broad discretion to pare back obama  s rule   would take about a year for the fcc to go through the formal rulemaking process to repeal obama  s network neutrality rule   then the litigation would begin   when ask lewis if group like would challenge an effort to roll back network neutrality rule   chuckle     think   a certainty that will challenge     say   but liberal group will face an uphill battle   because the court be relatively deferential to fcc decision about how to apply telecommunication law   a      supreme court decision bless a bush administration proposal to apply light regulation to the cable industry   and would serve as a powerful precedent for roll back    regulation in this area

winter        donald trump be not like that   while barack obama win the vote of a decent number of people who also have a favorable impression of mccain   trump triumph in the face of a badly divide opposition   perhaps most impressive political feat be trounce hillary clinton    among the    percent voter who view both candidate negatively   get    percent of the vote of people who say be not qualified to serve as president      percent of the vote of people who say lack the temperament to be president   and    percent of the vote of people who want the next president to be more liberal than obama     a normal person would have respond to this kind of strange victory with some sort of effort to reassure people or shore up support   but rather than pivot or mature   trump spend transition month feud with the intelligence community   offer the most divisive inaugural address in memory   and then on first full day in office go to langley to deliver what amount to a campaign rally in front of the cia  s memorial wall     these antic have take trump much further than anyone predict possibly could   and so evidently have no intention of abandon   but in parallel on saturday   million of people take to the street in city and town around the country to do the one thing opponent never really do during the campaign        take the prospect of a trump administration seriously   after benefit mightily from a fractured opposition that systematically underestimate candidacy   trump be now finally in for the fight of life         donald trump win because nobody think could donald trump win    percent of the popular vote on the way to victory        a victory drive by capture the electoral vote of seven state in which fail to capture a majority of the vote   wisconsin   michigan   pennsylvania   north carolina   florida   arizona   and utah       be elect anyway because many people who do not want to be president could not bring to vote for opponent   some of that be own fault   but some of be because trump   in an odd way   be the beneficiary of the perception that could not possibly win     people who feel would be a bad president feel secure in dissent from the democratic party to either the right   gary johnson   or the left   jill stein   because everyone know clinton would win anyway   almost everyone who have any kind of serious policy doubt about clinton invest vast time and energy in explore   regardless of whether or not have much more profound doubt about trump   because everyone know clinton would win anyway   mainstream journalist spend more time pore over potential    at clinton  s undoubtedly    charitable foundation than do detail the fact that trump  s foundation be a potentially criminal fraud that appear to have have no legitimate public benefit        everyone know clinton would win anyway     that be   obviously   a miscalculation   but   important to be clear about what the miscalculation be   trump  s opponent fail to unify around a single compelling alternative   be not popular on election day and be not popular on inauguration day   and   not do anything to try to turn that around     trump be in for the fight of life like any sensible pundit look back on        be get out of the political prediction game   but what see in saturday  s demonstration be that nobody be take trump  s defeat for grant anymore   the woman and man who march in city and town all across the country undoubtedly have different opinion about taxis and foreign policy and government email server protocol and    health care and bank regulation   agree that trump be alarming and that be incumbent upon   personally   to try to come together and do something about     the absence of that kind of attitude among the    percent of americans who do not vote for last november be one of the primary reason be able to win        now that be present   have lose one of main advantage     trump be a president who be in many way unusually vulnerable to protest     not a policy wonk who have the disposition to tune out the street theater and focus on issue   and policy agenda   as far as can tell   consist largely of unpopular cause like cut taxis on millionaire   deregulate bank   and strip million of health insurance   administration  s first policy action be to prevent homeowner from get a small schedule mortgage discount        also a president who be uniquely vulnerable due to conflict of interest   past wealthy president have hold asset in diversify fund manage by blind trust in part to avoid corruption   and conflict run both way        a    president would not want political adversary to be able to use private business interest against      mass demonstration can not be do every day   but even relatively    demonstration and act of civil disobedience targeting    hotel   golf course   office building   and apartment can be dramatic and telling     the need for law enforcement official to be perpetually intervene to safeguard trump  s personal financial interest will dramatize the corrupt nature of the setup in a more profound way than any number of preachy ethic document   protest could also potentially create the legal standing necessary to raise question about the validity of trump  s lease at the old post office and the emolument clause     the specter of vladimir

130212,195869,Donald Trump is preparing to make massive policy changes at the EPA,Vox,Brad Plumer,2017/1/23,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/1/23/14356652/trump-epa-regulations,  now that   president   donald trump be lay the groundwork to drastically reshape the environmental protection agency in the week and month ahead        all sign indicate that trump will soon issue a flurry of executive order as part of the process of weaken various air and water pollution rule and cut agency budget     all part of plan to dismantle president obama  s climate policy and make life easy for america  s fossil fuel industry   the big question be how quickly trump  s team will act        and what sort of obstacle will face from both federal court and career staff within the epa   on friday   trump take the very first step by order a   freeze   on all new regulation come out of federal agency   this be a standard move        george w  bush and barack obama issue similar order when take office        and only affect rule that have not be finalize     anticipate this   the obama administration race to finish a bunch of environmental regulation before leave   though have yet to publish four energy efficiency rule that will now be put on hold       a way for trump to hit pause while team prepare for bold action                next   trump  s team will move to tackle many of the exist environmental rule and regulation put in place under obama   there be basically five broad line of attack trump be expect to pursue           obama  s executive order on the environment can be cancel with a stroke of a pen   every president issue   executive order   that usually involve guidance to federal agency        these be straightforward to issue and not typically subject to judicial review   for instance   obama  s interior department put a moratorium on sell coal from federal land while figure out a new way to calculate royalty   obama also direct all federal agency to take climate change into account during formal environmental review       trump  s aide tell bloomberg that plan to cancel both of these obama order quickly        just take a simple memo   trump may also suspend the federal government  s use of the   social cost of carbon     an estimate of the damage cause by greenhouse gas emission that   use to help justify climate regulation     insideclimate have a list of other    executive order that could get axe         formal epa rule will take more time to revise and dismantle   under the obama administration   the epa also issue a number of more complex regulation that go through the formal rulemaking process   that include fuel economy standard for car and truck   the clean power plan to reduce co  from power plant   rule around mercury and ozone pollution   and much   much more       trump  s team intend to go after many of these rule   jonathan swan of axios get a look at an   agency action   plan that trump  s adviser have write up for the epa   among the initiative plan to target     clean air act greenhouse gas regulation for new   nsps   and exist   esps or the   clean power   plan   coal and natural gas power plant             cafe   standards           clean water section       water of the u  s  rule   wetland             tmdl   total maximum daily load   for chesapeake bay     that say   if trump want to repeal or modify these rule   can not just do so with the stroke of a pen   the epa would have to formally start the    rulemaking process all over again   that mean notify the public of any rule change   solicit public comment for those change   respond to all those public comment   and then rigorously justify new rule        likely before the court   that last part be hard than sound   the clean air act require the epa to regulate many different pollutant   include greenhouse gas   so trump  s team can not just say     do not like this regulation     too expensive     would have to come up with a legally sound argument for why   say   the clean power plan be an inappropriate way to regulate co  from power plant and what would do differently     if try to shortchange this process and rush out a brand new rule   really will not go well for when get into court     say jody freeman   a harvard law school professor and former climate adviser to obama         hard to predict how successful trump will be here   pick to run the epa   former oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt   spend a lot of time sue the obama administration over many of rule and be familiar with the legal process here   but the court reject pruitt  s argument over and over again while be in oklahoma   the green group that will be fight pruitt be very skilled at this kind of litigation        and tend to win a lot of these battle     that say   trump  s team can still delay regulation for year and year here   even if ultimately lose in court                     congress could quickly undo some   but not all   of obama  s epa rule   meanwhile   under a    law know as the congressional review act   republicans in the house and senate can kill by majority vote certain    rule finish after late may          unclear how much time congress want to devote to this   have get a lot on plate   but here be a list of obama rule that would be vulnerable to cra disapproval   include emission standard for landfill   rule around offshore drilling   methane standard for oil and gas drilling   and restriction on migratory bird hunting       trump and congress can chip away at the epa through budget cut   accord to the agency action plan swan uncover   trump  s team also plan to push for major budget cut to the epa   such as           million in cut to the   state and tribal assistance grant                   million in saving from terminate climate program                 million in saving from   environment program and management       congress will ultimately have the final say over these cut        though many republicans in both the house and senate have be push to shrink epa  s budget for year     and certain change make through the budget reconciliation process will be much hard for senate democrats to block     if the gop succeed   the agency could end up with less ability to monitor pollution and enforce many of rule effectively       trump could try to hamstring the agency in other way go forward   in the agency action plan   trump  s adviser be not just concerned with repeal    rule   also want to hamper future regulation   via swan   here   a quote from the plan     unless major reform of the agency  s use of science and economic be achieve   epa will be able to return to bad old way as soon as an establishment administration take office     the document talk about overhaul the epa  s science advisory process to eliminate   inherent bias       mean   inherent bias   in favor of highlight the harm from climate change or air pollution     any such move here be likely to meet resistance from career staff and career scientist within the epa   who do not tend to share trump  s view that   say   global warming be all an overblown hoax   but one question be whether will see an exodus of government scientist        something that happen in canada under stephen harper and do last damage to the country  s scientific capacity        congress could also get involved in try to restrict the epa go forward   for instance   republicans could try to amend the clean air act so that the epa have no authority over greenhouse gas   or could try to pass the reins act   which would require that every major new epa rule be subject to an     vote from congress   which would kill a lot of new regulation     both of these measure   however   could be subject to a filibuster by    senate democrats   there be a lot of move part here        what congress do   what the court do   how the generally     career staff react to trump  s move   yank a large federal bureaucracy in an entirely new direction be never easy   and remain to be see if trump can pull this off   remember that epa protection be broadly popular with the public   and remember that ronald reagan also try to gut the epa in the        go very badly   and eventually have to back down   further reading     this be a useful tracker of trump  s climate deregulation move from the sabin center for climate change law at columbia law school   check out this    interview with jody freeman for much more detail on all the obstacle trump could face in dismantle obama  s epa rule     not just trump   the gop have long be attack many of obama  s energy and environmental rule   and be finally in a position to do something about   well   bar a filibuster     scott pruitt   trump  s epa pick   be an ardent foe of virtually everything obama  s epa have do      watch   a history

the same pattern     the nominee be announce at      am eastern on tuesday   january            there be always two or three    lock   then there  s at least one more that look pretty solid   and then the fight for the last spot be absolute pandemonium   with seemingly hundred of different potential nominee have a viable shot   but the fact that there be so many name compete for so few nod make almost even more exciting   have analyze the result of several important precursor award        hand out by critic group and industry organization        survey top    list   and just generally follow the late industry buzz   after all of that   here be oscar nomination prediction in the top eight category   good picture              predict best picture be always difficult   because the number of nominee can range anywhere from five to      the oscar    process reward passion   mostly        in that a movie with a very small but very vocal fan base can squeak in if all of fan vote   however   the process can also reward movie with a lot of   sure   guess like that well enough   vote        in that contain an element of instant runoff voting   where people  s    and    vote could end up be count     here   a full explanation of how the oscars voting process work         usually the breakdown of the good picture category be such that three quarter of the nominee appeal to the large possible swath of the academy   and    have ardent fan whose vote will not be sway       and in a year where there be three strong   clear frontrunner        la la land   moonlight   and manchester by the sea        weird thing can happen   the    vote cast by people who support the top three will probably count for much more than usual   since the top three be such lock   and movie with a tiny but vocal fan base stand a great chance of withstand the whole process to squeeze into one of the remain spot by come in second or third on ballot for the top three   but let think about what oscar voter be look for   broadly speak   there be a few different   camp   of oscar voter   and each favor different thing   mark harris first introduce to this idea over at grantland   and define seven type of voter   think can condense harris  s category down to five   be         the artistic masterpiece voter   there be not many of   but be out there   and be typically draw to massive directorial achievement     the technical masterpiece voter   tend to back movie with big   big image and lot of design element        like massive set or impressive visual effect     the classicist voter   tend to vote with a   just do not make like that anymore   vibe   there be not as many as there use to be   but be still a sizable faction     the actor   there be more actor among the academy  s         member than any other group   and tend to like movie with memorable performance or big   perfectly cast ensemble     the social issue voter   want movie to say something about the world today       if be wonder why la la land be such a runaway favorite in        well   appeal to every group mention above except the   social issue voter       since switch to the   five to    nominee   system in        the oscars have have nine good picture nominee three time and eight nominee twice   be predict eight this year   but would not be surprised in the slight if a ninth sneak in to join   prediction   arrival fences hell or high water hidden figures la la land lion manchester by the sea moonlight   let break down these pick by likelihood   the top three   la la land   manchester by the sea   and moonlight have win or be nominate just about everywhere   trade off critic award   get nominate at the golden globes and major industry award   and    at the box office   if any one of be not nominate   will be a true shock       the probably nominate next two   normally   a nomination from the directors guild of america be a good indication movie will be nominate for good picture at the oscars     only one movie have miss best picture after a dga nomination in the era of the expand good picture lineup         s the girl with the dragon tattoo       the dga nominee include the oscars top three   plus arrival and lion   if one of those two be miss out     probably lion   which have struggle at the box office and with critic   be honest   have even hear of     but be also the sort of sappy middlebrow    the academy often love   the   precedent suggest will be nominate   but never say never   duo   fence and hidden figure manage nomination for top prize from both the producers guild and the screen actors guild   and both be box office success story   with hidden figure look like a genuine hit   be probably in   but since launch late in the season   on christmas day     possible be     the   who the hell know     slot   be go with hell or high water   because seem like a safe bet for nomination in supporting actor and original screenplay   and because feel like a movie with heavy appeal to old white male voter   who still make up a lot of the academy   as well as    voter who may appreciate the film  s focus on rural economic desperation   but once get down this low in ranking   anything could happen   other possible contender for a long time   look like mel gibson  s    war drama hacksaw ridge would pull out a nomination   but buzz seem to have fade in the home stretch   still   if there   a ninth nominee   would expect to be this one   another movie that initially appear to be a potentially huge contender but summarily fade be martin scorsese  s silence   most prognosticator have remove from the running entirely   but if there   a director in play that the academy reflexively love this year     scorsese   so a surprise nomination would not be out of the question        finally   there be three extremely unusual potential nominee hang out way in the outer limit of oscardom   one be tom ford  s nocturnal animals        which   with weird   campy tone   would be an enormously unexpected nominee but which have a lot of fan   another be pablo larra n  s jackie   which reimagine jackie kennedy  s life as a kind of gorgeous collage and deserve well buzz than   receive   and finally   some people think deadpool could be nominate   but let just not even pretend that could happen   best director              outside of the good picture race   the other category be easy to predict   be limited to five nominee each   and be decide by a much less complicated voting system involve particular   branch   of the academy     good picture be the only award

barry jenkins   moonlight    kenneth lonergan   manchester by the sea    martin scorsese   silence    denis villeneuve   arrival    the top three reign supreme again   and should easily garner chazelle   jenkins   and lonergan first nomination in this category     both chazelle and lonergan have past nod for screenwriting     follow up those three with the     villeneuve   who   also a dga nominee   the oscars be usually reticent to nominate a lineup of all    director nominee   that   not to say can not happen   but since all eight of predict good picture nominee be from director who have never be nominate here before   expect the director branch to go look for a familiar face        and land right on martin scorsese   other contender by default   lion  s garth davis have a great shot here   since be nominate at the dga   though that group rarely go     with the oscar director lineup     and of the other director who helm predict good picture nominee        fence   denzel washington   hidden figure   ted melfi   and hell or high water  s david mackenzie        mackenzie feel the most like a potential spoiler to lineup above   also would not count out nocturnal animals   tom ford     both hacksaw ridge  s mel gibson and sully  s clint eastwood be probably too mired in controversy to be nominate   gibson for numerous scandal   eastwood for be a reluctant but vocal trump supporter in liberal hollywood   but hey   both be former winner and eastwood   a frequent nominee   never know       good actor              normally   good actor be one of the most exciting   contentious race   that   not really the case this year        for the second year in a row   there   a theoretically exciting race between the two frontrunner   and a couple of exciting performance in    position   but after that   the category fall off a cliff   and may as well just cancel the fifth slot entirely   prediction    casey affleck   manchester by the sea    andrew garfield   hacksaw ridge    ryan gosling   la la land    viggo mortensen   captain fantastic    denzel washington   fences    for starter   affleck and washington have own this category for what feel like a solid year now   and seem like safe bet   can follow up with gosling   who make a potentially insufferable character vaguely charming   and garfield   who be the lead in both hacksaw and silence and lock up the unusual   christian have faith test in japan   subgenre for the year   the final spot look likeliest to go to mortensen   but captain fantastic be an awful film and nobody seem too excited about work   those two factor could portend mischief to come   other contender when come to   realistic   contender   there   really only one   loving  s joel edgerton   as one half of the interracial couple whose gentle persistence see    law strike down in the us   but in a category this threadbare   crazy thing can happen   which be why probably should not count out deadpool  s ryan reynolds   much as hate to say     paterson be the good movie of        and adam driver more than deserve a nomination for   but will not happen   too bad     good actress              this will be the most exciting acting race of the night   with a contender list that   very   very deep for a category that oscar voter have have trouble populate as recently as        yes   there be frontrunner   but there   also a healthy degree of uncertainty here   for the first time in a while   prediction    amy adams   arrival    isabelle huppert   elle    natalie portman   jackie    emma stone   la la land    meryl streep   florence foster jenkins    stone be probably go to win   there be a time when the category seem like a close race between and portman   but so far   portman have struggle to gain traction   cede most of   critical favorite   territory to huppert   who win at the golden globes   though huppert be not nominate at the sag   so   far from a sure thing     after those three   adams be a safe bet for not just star in arrival   but turn into a surprise hit   and then   a craze    with all sort of potential scenario   think   good to bet on streep   whose fan base vote for year in and year out   and golden globes speech be not go to hurt with oscar voter either     other contender if streep be ultimately edge out   hope  s by   th century women  s annette bening   who give one of the year  s good   most understated performance   there   also a chance that loving  s ruth negga or hidden figure   taraji p  henson could sneak in   though the latter  s film release very late   and the former  s film never take off as an award contender to the degree that would help in this crowd category   and emily blunt keep get nominate by various award body for the girl on the train   so would better mention as well     would also like to suggest two brilliant comedic performance   from love   friendship  s kate beckinsale and edge of seventeen  s hailee steinfeld   but neither actress will earn a nomination         good supporting actress              in contrast with lead actress cousin   this category be a bit forlorn     not as sparse as good actor   but   definitely see well day   prediction    viola davis   fences    greta gerwig     th century women    naomie harris   moonlight    nicole kidman   lion    michelle williams   manchester by the sea    davis be the enormous frontrunner here   with only williams pose a real threat   so consider the two of fairly safe   harris have mostly receive the critic and industry nomination need to join   and kidman be the sort of actress who occasionally get nominate   when the oscars remember exist   the final spot be tricky   but something tell   th century women have be a touch underestimate   which could result in a nomination for gerwig   who   in a less competitive category than    bening   other contender most other prognosticator be side with hidden figure   octavia spencer over gerwig for the fifth spot   but strike as a little nuts that   the target of the movie  s award buzz   instead of costar henson and janelle mon e   who would also be nominate in this category     spencer   a former winner in this category for the help   do what can with the material   give   but role and performance be the film  s least impressive     beyond that   this category feel too empty   which suggest that some sort of major surprise could happen        or   more likely   not   best supporting actor              another overstuffed category   where most oscar ceremony have overflow good actor and best support actress category   the precise opposite have happen this year   with the good lead actress and good supporting actor offer the great bounty to choose from     prediction    mahershala ali   moonlight    jeff bridges   hell or high water    hugh grant   florence foster jenkins    dev patel   lion    aaron    nocturnal animals    literally the only two nominee be confident in here be ali and bridges   with the former appear to be a likely winner   after that   the category be mass chaos   of the other three nominee   would be most likely to put money on patel   who   at least in a prospective best picture nominee and be sort of the film  s lead     because character be play by a child actor for the film  s first half   can realistically campaign here     then there   grant   who   never be nominate and could get a boost from the streep train   finally      win at the golden globes and give a big   hammy performance     not a good performance   but when have that stop the oscars in the past       other contender if be go to bump any of the above name   can probably replace with lucas hedges from manchester by the sea   though performance may be too understated   after that   this category be a wild assault of name who probably will not be nominate but also would not be too surprising if be   hidden figure   kevin costner   nocturnal animals   michael shannon   hell or high water  s ben foster   hacksaw ridge  s vince vaughn   seemingly dozen of actor from fences and silence   and   hey   if the oscars go truly la la land crazy   maybe john legend sneak in   will not     can request a nomination for    cloverfield lane  s john goodman   no   bah   best original screenplay              before discuss these category   check out this explainer on oscar category confusion   will clarify why some   base on a true story   film be original   while other be adapt     in short   depend on whether use one primary source or own research     also kind of a stupid rule     prediction     th century women hell or high water la la land the lobster manchester by the sea   for a while   look like there would be a gigantic battle between the top three        until moonlight get shunt off to the adapted category     yes     technically base on an unproduced play   but barry jenkins essentially completely rewrote     now   just manchester by the sea versus la la land   with manchester look like the favorite   if a stealth contender break out   look out for the rich script from hell or high water   after that   this race be a bloodbath   the lobster feel safest          the sort of weirdo conceit the writer branch of the academy often love   and then will lean toward   th century women   because   again   just sort of feel like will have a solid oscar showing   other contender so many   could make a great case for the animate zootopia   which be one of the year  s big hit and win praise for occasionally clever metaphor for prejudice   guess captain fantastic could happen   too   but   again   be awful   jackie feel like a surefire thing for a while   until be not   and also would not count out german film toni erdmann   if only because the writer branch be the likeliest branch outside of the director branch to embrace a    film     but be only scratch the surface of this stack category   if do not just list one of the nominee   will not be a surprise       best adapted screenplay              most year   the screenplay category travel in tandem        when one be weak   the other be strong   that   certainly true this year   as adapted be a little soft   in comparison to original  s strength   prediction   arrival deadpool fences moonlight nocturnal animals   the two safe bet here be arrival and moonlight   if only because of strength in other category   move beyond that   thing get more interesting   the people who hate nocturnal animals really hate   but also seem like a movie writer would like   with complicated   film within the film   screenplay structure   would also guess the academy would love to nominate the deceased playwright august wilson for screenplay for fences   finally   if there   one branch that appreciate toil in the blockbuster mine    snarky dialogue     this one   so would bet that   sigh   deadpool get in   other contender most prognosticator be side with lion here   but think that film be precisely the kind of sapfest the writer will avoid   could also make a great argument for hidden figures   but   again   campaign start really late   maybe elle   as say above   the writer be friendly to foreign film than most branch   so why not     watch   the oscars   voting process award bland movie     
130214,195871,Trump just pulled out of the TPP free trade deal,Vox,Zeeshan Aleem,2017/1/23,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/23/14356398/trump-pull-out-tpp-nafta,  donald trump be walk the walk   first executive order during first full work day as president be to withdraw from the negotiation process over the    partnership   the gargantuan free trade agreement that would rail against on the campaign trail as a job killer and promise to do away with       the move fulfill one of trump  s signature campaign pledge to get out of the sweeping    trade deal   which once deem   a rape of country     and mark a major blow to the washington consensus on free trade   while trump make the move in a bid to protect american job from go overseas   do entail a    with the country that consider the american worker  s foremost threat   china will now have more space to ramp up economic dominance in asia   the deal be one of the obama administration  s signature foreign policy initiative   make death the first one of president obama  s major effort that trump have dismantle   would have strengthen trade tie between    pacific rim country account for    percent of global gdp   make the large such deal in history   trump rail against the polarizing agreement over and over again on the campaign trail   and promise to torpedo the deal upon take office   now have     the first concrete action that indicate that trump will indeed be reshape the us  s trade relationship with the world in accordance with the   america first   ethos promote on path to the white house   combine with report that could also sign an executive order call for a renegotiation of nafta as early as monday     clear right out of the gate of the trump presidency that there   at least one part of the bipartisan washington consensus that trump be willing to upend   free trade        why the tpp matter so much the tpp would have boosted trade tie between the us and    country along the pacific rim that have a combine gdp of          trillion   during the      presidential campaign   the accord garner criticism from both side of the aisle   trump   sen  bernie sanders   and eventually hillary clinton criticize as an agreement that would cause an uptick in unemployment and suppress wage   sander and many advocate on the left also stridently oppose for a host of other reason   range from concern about environmental regulation and labor standard to provision that would potentially have give corporation enormous power in shape member country   public policy        after five year of arduous negotiation   the tpp be sign by trade representative of the    country last february   but still have to be ratify by the individual country   government   and congress do not do so while obama be in office   now trump  s withdrawal ensure that congress will never be vote on      trump  s decision to ax the tpp be also effectively first major move on china        although   actually one that weaken the us  s hand relative to beijing   the accord would have strengthen tie between the us and a number of china  s neighbor   but do not include china   would have served as a counterweight to beijing  s increase influence in the region   with the tpp in tatter   china have a major opportunity to step into that vacuum and negotiate a regional trade deal that basically serve as a    version of the tpp     already be make effort to do exactly that          trump have also indicate that   go to renegotiate nafta        the free trade agreement that virtually eliminate tariff on good flow between the us   canada   and mexico        in order to curb the flow of us job and factory to mexico   but at the moment   unclear how would actually go about pursue that goal in a manner that mexico would agree to     tpp be not the only big trade decision trump have to make so what   next   the tpp be a giant lightning rod for criticism   but   not the only major free trade deal in trump  s hand   there be two other major initiative that have hardly get a fraction of the attention of the tpp but be at least as important for the american economy        the transatlantic trade and investment partnership   or ttip   and trade in services agreement   or tisa   ttip be a free trade accord that would significantly reduce trade barrier between the us and the european union   and have be in the negotiation stage since        fate be entirely up in the air        and not only because trump have a demonstrate aversion to big free trade deal   europe have express deep concern about threat to regulation and standard on issue like food safety that fear would be degrade by ttip  s stipulation         tisa   which trade representative have be negotiate since        be a    accord that would dwarf even the tpp   there   good reason to think that trump would be hostile to this one   consider that a service accord would be accompany by rule on freedom of movement in a manner that would be very much at odd with trump  s hawkish immigration position     other than those free trade agreement   trump be indicate that will pursue bilateral trade agreement        accord between the us and just one other country   the big one trade observer be anticipate would probably be between the us and the uk   which be now in the process of leave the eu in part due to own skepticism of the    that accompany lower trade barrier between country   trump could also try to pursue bilateral trade deal with major economy that would have lower trade barrier with the us under the tpp like japan      trump  s view on certain issue like what will be do with the affordable care act or medicare be difficult to divine   but on trade   have a fairly clear vision that   pursue quickly   in a way that   bind to swiftly reshape the status of vital economic relationship and trade the world over

abortion with patient as an option for family planning        trump have promise to take sweeping action against abortion   include appoint supreme court justice who would overturn roe v  wade   reinstating and expand the global gag rule be the first indication of how serious be   the global gag rule have become something of a political seesaw since ronald reagan first implement in      at a united nations population conference in mexico city   which be why  s also call the   mexico city policy       bill clinton repeal immediately when take office   george w  bush immediately reinstate when take office   then barack obama immediately repeal       but trump do more than just reinstate the    policy        expand to an unprecedented degree   the gag rule will apply to    time more funding than normal because apply to all global health funding   not just family planning funding through usaid   united states agency for international development   or the state department        trump  s version of the gag rule will apply to roughly         billion dollar in global health funding   as oppose to roughly       million in family planning and reproductive health funding   accord to population action international   pai   a global family planning advocacy organization         trump  s global gag rule be cruel and unusual in that massively expand an already harmful policy     say a statement from pai     this grotesque expansion target the most effective health organization in    low and middle income country       the funding cut will go far beyond abortion   and even beyond contraception   will likely prevent many global health organization from offer hiv prevention and treatment service   maternal health care   and zika virus prevention        the effect of reinstate and expand the gag rule now        especially after eight year of the obama administration   which support sexual and reproductive health in foreign aid        will be very messy   advocate say   the ripple effect and unintended consequence will have devastating effect on the health of woman and girl around the globe   and while will export the us abortion war overseas   only foreign woman will be the casualty       trump  s global gag rule will obstruct and destroy the work of health care provider who be often woman  s main        and sometimes only        source for reproductive health care   and entry point for receive a wide range of primary health care service     say suzanne ehlers   president and ceo of pai   in a statement     the gag rule do    damage to woman  s health abroad   the global gag rule go much further than simply ban us foreign aid from pay for abortion directly        which be already the law   and which have own detrimental consequence for woman         instead   the gag rule try to control how international organization use own fund   raise from other source     just like republican effort to defund planned parenthood in the united states     an attempt to stop abortion from happen by force organization that provide to make a choice   stop provide or promote abortion   or lose the large amount of funding that get from the us government to support other medical service       but large global family planning organization   like the international planned parenthood federation and marie stopes international   be not simply go to stop offer abortion care or counseling worldwide        and so will lose funding   in a statement   the international planned parenthood    hemisphere region     confirm that will not sign on to the gag rule  s condition     as a    health organization that seek to protect and enhance the life of woman   man and young people throughout the americas and caribbean      will not sign a policy that deny human right and put the life of woman at risk       marie stopes international also release a statement in response to the executive order   assert that the organization   know that safe abortion be a vital component of woman  s reproductive healthcare   and therefore can not agree to these condition       the reality be simple and brutal   reinstate the global gag rule will not reduce abortion      africa   for instance   have high abortion rate after george w  bush reinstate the gag rule   because reduce woman  s access to contraception and cause more unwanted pregnancy   which woman then choose to terminate         ssa country more reliant on usaid for reproductive health see big rise in abortion after      global gag rule https         pic   twitter          charles kenny    charlesjkenny   january               the gag rule will   however   lead to more woman die across the develop world   marie stopes international estimate that without alternative funding   the loss of service alone will cause       million unintended pregnancy         million abortion         million unsafe abortion   and          maternal death just in trump  s first term   from      to        the

country bear unwanted pregnancy   die or become disabled due to unsafe abortion   or lose crucial medical care     after obama lift the gag rule in        pai director of advocacy jonathan rucks tell vox   large international family planning organization like marie stopes international and the international planned parenthood federation be able to bring crucial contraceptive service to area like west africa that be poorly serve before   but with the gag rule back in effect   large geographic area may simply lose service   include birth control     the gag rule hurt not just abortion access   not just contraception access   but other form of health care as well   ruck say   in many develop country   woman get reproductive health care at the same place get all of other care   so when health care provider lose fund due to the gag rule   slash funding and cause nurse to be lay off for all health care service the provider offer   and the rule have both direct and indirect consequence   ruck tell vox   because the obama administration have such supportive sexual and reproductive health policy   the united states be able to partner with other donor government   like the united kingdom and sweden   that also support reproductive freedom   but those government   will not be as likely to want to pool fund with   for international aid if the trump administration implement such negative and harmful policy   ruck say     the gag rule be not the only us policy that have this overall effect   but have earn a reputation among human right advocate as a particularly cruel   draconian measure that exist for one purpose only   appease    opponent of legal abortion in the united states    
130216,195874,Cancer scientists are having trouble replicating groundbreaking research,Vox,Julia Belluz,2017/1/23,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/23/14324326/replication-science-is-hard,  replication have emerge as a powerful tool to check science and get closer to the truth   researcher take an experiment that   already be do   and test whether conclusion hold up by reproduce   the general principle be that if the result repeat   then the original result be correct and reliable   if do not   then the first study must be flaw   or finding false         but there   a big wrinkle with replication study   do not work like that   as researcher reproduce more experiment   be learn that can not always get clear answer about the reliability of the original result   replication   seem   be a whole lot murky than think     take the late finding from the    reproducibility project   cancer biology   here   researcher focus on reproduce experiment from the    paper about cancer biology publish from      to        share result in five paper in the journal elife last week        and not one of replication definitively confirm the original result     the finding echo those of another landmark reproducibility project   which   like the cancer biology project   come from the center for open science   this time   the researcher replicate major psychology study        and only    percent of confirm the original conclusion       replicating study   turn out   be really   really hard   for to get easy   scientist be go to have to learn to be much more transparent about process   be also go to need to start look at replication study with the same critical gaze reserve for single study of any kind       replicating study be really   really hard replicate a study do not just mean read the paper and try to run again     more like try to play a complicate board game without all the instruction or even all the part     to pull off the replication study in cancer biology   the researcher have to go back to the author of the original paper and ask to share any information may have leave out of method section and any additional unpublished datum that help arrive at conclusion        then come up with a plan for reproduce the study   and get that plan peer review        include by the original author   statistician   and expert in the relevant field       sometimes would learn be do the wrong experiment   and would go back and make the change     say tim errington   who lead the cancer reproducibility project   once the change be accept   the real work would begin   run the experiment     after write up the result   pass through peer review and the original author be invite to weigh in again     not every author want to participate   of course   which sometimes make the process even harder         sometimes   thing as small as the temperature of the lab could cause a cell biology experiment to flop   errington say   other researcher who have replicated psychology study say have to overcome language and cultural barrier in translate the original science to a new lab   the takeaway here be that replication can go off the rail very easily if researcher do not take the utmost care        and even when do     if a replication fail   may be a bad replication        not necessarily a bad original study interpret the result of a replication study be another place where thing can get messy   fast   and increasingly scientist be realize that if a replication fail to reproduce the original result   do not mean the original be wrong     with the reproducibility project   cancer biology   not one of the replication definitively confirm the original result   two of the paper reproduce part of the original experiment   one fail to reproduce the original experiment entirely   and the other two replication be impossible to interpret because of technical problem with the model     could be that the original be false positive     errington say     could be that the replication be a false negative   that the replication do something wrong   or probably that be both right        the original be right   and the replication be right        and what   occur be that do not know the cause of the discrepancy       in other word   there be any number of reason a replication may fail   and may say nothing about the quality of the original research       a single failure to replicate be no more definitive than a single study claim discovery     bristol researcher marcus munaf    who recently    a manifesto for reproducible science   tell     give the latter   need to do more of the former and not just assume that a single study claim discovery be robust          do replication study properly be costly and time consuming   say lawrence tabak   the principal deputy director at the national institutes of health   which   mean can not do wholesale replication        but there be likely a subset of study really should consider do replication       for example   researcher should try to replicate finding from animal study before move to costlier human study       let  s say a   replication study of an animal study would cost half a million dollar     tabak say     one could argue that   a lot of money        why spend   the answer be would want to do be certain the key experimental result could be replicate before spend     million on a first in human study       the neurology and age center at the nih already do this   add   and the nih recently release guideline on reproduce research   scientist and journal need to get well at describe method and share datum whenever have talk to researcher who have do replication study   become clear pretty quickly that endeavor will not go so well if do not have    from the researcher who do the original study   that   because the method section of research paper        which describe how an experiment be do        often be not very detailed       one of the big barrier to reproducibility be simply know how the original research be do     say brian nosek   who    the center for open science   which support the cancer biology and psychology reproducibility project     a great degree of transparency and datum sharing would make replication easy        and more reliable   so researcher need to get well at describe method in detail and share datum          there may be some result that can be reproduce all the time very easily   other that get reproduce under very specific condition   and other that be not reproduce at all   the emerge picture be that the two last category may be very common     stanford    john ioannidis say in an

majorly shake up world order   the future be now look pretty uncertain        but   not so bad   human being be lucky   for most other specie of primate        the branch of mammal belong to        the future be far   far more uncertain   for most primate   there may be no future     a new report in science advances find around    percent of primate specie be threaten with extinction   all due to the action of   well     the report   which be the most comprehensive analysis of primate population in the world to date   also conclude    percent of primate specie have decline population   the report find every member of the primate family hominidae   great ape   which include gorilla and chimpanzee   be endanger or critically threaten   except for     around    percent of indriidae   large lemur   be similarly endanger or threaten        not all primate family be do so poorly   just a few specie of galagidae   bushbaby   be threaten     if have never google   galagidae   before   do now   look at those eye                 everywhere primate live   scientist find decline          of specie in madagascar be threaten   as be      in asia        in mainland africa   and      in the

          biodiversity     the author conclude           the reason primate be die be not surprising   deforestation via logging   mining   agriculture   oil exploration   and hunting be identify as the top reason   these intrusion can result in forest fragmentation that lead primate population to be cut off from one another   that reduce genetic diversity   which further reduce ability to survive change in the environment     and then there   the threat of climate change   scientist admit do not fully understand climate change  s impact on primate   but surely will not help the situation     not all bad   however   the report point out that a few specie be better equipped to adapt to these change than other        some primate be more behaviorally and ecologically resilient than other when face with habitat loss   fragmentation   and degradation   bornean orangutan   for example   can survive   at least temporarily   in logged forest   acacia plantation   and oil palm plantation   baboon   papio   hanuman langur   semnopithecus   and macaque   macaca   be particularly adaptable and can survive even in urban area   chimpanzee appear to evaluate risk when    and adjust forage pattern in decide whether to exploit fragmented forest near human   bonobos tend to avoid area of high human activity   fragmented forest   or both   and although this may suggest flexibility   the presence of human appear to significantly reduce access to potentially available habitat   but a world with just a handful of primate specie be not ideal   and   not just because of the loss of biodiversity   and the result chaos inflict on ecosystem       the loss of primate be the loss of evolutionary history             primates be close relative on earth   if can understand better   can understand   here   how carl zimmer at the new york times explain     the first primate evolve roughly    million year ago   and then split into the live lineage over million of year   by compare biology to those of other primate   have learn about the evolution of brain   vision and vulnerability to disease   when lose the primate   lose a bit of     consider the work of primatologist frans de waal   for decade   have make thousand of observation of primate community     show that many primate will console one another after fight     see hug and kiss   in           a paper in the proceedings of the national academy of science compile datum from more than         observation of chimpanzee fight   the paper find that chimp will commonly console the loser of fight        a behavior especially pronounce among chimp with kinship bond   work suggest that human empathy have a biological basis that predate humanity        that   a profound conclusion   which would be impossible to reach if there be no primate to study in the first place   the scientist   warning be dire   but do not think   too late   suggest expand protect wildlife sanctuary   crack down on the illegal bushmeat trade   educate the public on conservation   and be smart about development       have one last opportunity to greatly reduce or even eliminate the human threat to primate and habitat   to guide conservation effort   and to raise worldwide awareness of predicament     the author write     primate be critically important to humanity   after all   be close live biological relative

130219,195877,Why the Women’s March on Washington drew bigger crowds than Trump’s inauguration,Vox,Emily

street of washington   dc on saturday        a crowd roughly three time big than the audience at    donald trump  s inauguration the day before   crowd scientist tell the new york times   nationwide   the women  s march may have be the large demonstration in us history   with at least       million people attend marche in more than     city         organizers say the event be a march for woman  s right   not a protest against trump   but for all practical purpose   the rally become the large gathering on inauguration weekend of people who either oppose trump or be seriously worried about what will do as president     not surprising why trump  s inauguration have a low turnout when compare with previous inauguration   particularly obama  s   approval rating be historically low for a new president just take office   and lose the popular vote by nearly   million vote     but that do not explain why the women  s march   specifically   draw so many people   may seem remarkable that of all the concern many americans have about a trump presidency        include the open racial resentment that campaign fuel   and many conflict of interest and troubling tie to russia   to name a few        that view on woman would inspire the most people to gather in the street         but accord to a massive new    survey on how americans view gender issue   this development should not surprise at all        perryundem   a nonpartisan public opinion research firm in washington   dc   release last week what may be the most comprehensive public survey that exist   at least in recent year   on americans   view toward gender equality   sexism   and woman  s right     the    poll cover a lot of ground   both on general attitude about gender equality and on how americans feel about specific gender issue surround the      election   the poll be conduct from december   through             among a nationally representative sample of         adult   with an oversampling of black and latino adult for more accurate result about that demographic        one of the poll  s many strike finding be this   while may not have lose trump the election in the end   the leaked      access hollywood tape that feature trump brag about ability to sexually assault woman        specifically   that could   grab   woman   by the pussy     kiss without consent   and do whatever want to because   a star        have a major impact on many americans   and have not be forget     most americans survey      percent   remember hear about the tape   almost all of those survey      percent   say find trump  s comment   unacceptable     and most      percent overall      percent of woman   and    percent of man   say feel   upset   by the comment     and many of those who feel upset be actually motivated to do something about          trump  s leak comment about sexual assault may have directly inspire many people to take political action the survey ask respondent whether   as a direct result of trump  s win   have decide to take various action        from talk to kid about sexual assault and consent to donate to an organization to think about run for office or help more woman get elect       of respondent say have do one or more of these thing                  percent also say have take one or more of three political action that do not specifically relate to gender   donate to an organization   figure out how to get more involved in political issue   and pay more attention to elect official   action     and when perryundem analyze the factor that correlate with just those    political action   find something interesting     be   upset   about the trump tape be the most reliable predictor of how likely someone be to take political action as a direct result of trump  s election   the second most   reliable predictor of take political action be the belief that the country would be well off with more woman in political office     no other factor   include party affiliation   be significantly correlate with take political action   even after rule out how people feel about trump  s comment on that tape   a respondent  s general feeling about trump   whether favorable or not   do not correlate with political action either       these finding give extra statistical weight to the many report that woman  s political organization be see a huge surge of woman interested in learn how to run for office   many woman   seem        motivate by trump  s win and clinton  s loss        be try to be the change want to see in the world when come to woman  s representation in government      the poll have many other significant finding on gender attitude in general   and the      election specifically             the poll be design by perryundem partner tresa undem and mike perry   who take the unusual step for a polling firm of design own survey rather than work on behalf of a client   firm  s other research over the past few year have turn up a lot of anger and frustration among americans over woman  s right   perry tell reporter on a press call tuesday        and worry that if do not get a detailed baseline measurement of these broad attitude   nobody else would     the      presidential election be   of course   dominate by gender politic   pit donald trump  s hypermasculinity   and the revelation that more than a dozen woman have accuse of sexual assault   against hillary clinton   a lifelong    feminist who could have be the first woman president of the united states     but until now have very little datum   other than exit poll   on what voter really think about specific gender issue and how potentially shape vote   when come to the trump tape   for instance   more woman say feel   upset   than man      percent versus    percent     one in five woman      percent   report mental or emotional stress   and one in eight woman      percent   say the tape cause to reexperience a past trauma   that   consistent with many medium account   own include   on how survivor of rape and domestic violence have feel trigger both by the trump tape specifically and by trump  s abusive rhetoric more generally     the poll also yield interesting result when respondent be ask how feel about woman in government   who make well leader   woman or man   would the country be well off if more woman be in government   or not          of man and    of woman who vote for trump      and    percent   respectively   say that man generally make well political leader than woman   compare with    percent of respondent overall   and    percent of trump voter   compare with    percent of man who vote for clinton and   percent of woman who vote for clinton   disagree that the country would be well off with more woman in political office      these result fit into a broad pattern suggest by the survey result   while an overwhelming majority of survey taker      percent   say support equality for woman   many americans still hold at least some sexist attitude   that include   benevolent   sexist attitude        the kind that put woman on a pedestal   as long as conform to expect gender norm   that be   and obscure the fact that woman be just human being like everyone else     and   as other research have indicate   hostile attitude toward woman be most common among trump voter        both man and woman     but overt hostility to woman also have a steep political cost   galvanize people to take action   that   why the women  s march on washington become a worldwide phenomenon   and why be a much big deal in dc than the inauguration      watch   meet the women  s march on washington

130223,195883,The House just passed a sweeping abortion funding ban. Here’s what it does.,Vox,Emily Crockett,2017/1/24,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/24/14370748/taxpayer-funded-abortion-house-passed-permanent-hyde-amendment,  day after the women  s march on washington   the trump administration and republicans in congress launch attack on public funding for woman  s health care        on monday   president trump reinstate the global gag rule   which strip all us funding from foreign aid group that counsel patient on abortion   rather than decrease abortion rate   the move be likely to increase   devastate the global health system in the process   and leave million of woman across the globe without access to either safe abortion or contraception     and on tuesday afternoon   house republicans vote    to permanently ban us woman   too   from receive any federal financial assistance for abortion        whether be insure through public program like medicaid or if purchase private health insurance on the affordable care act exchange     the bill would codify exist restriction that make abortion harder for poor woman to get the text of the bill   hr     introduce by rep  christopher smith     state that purpose be to   prohibit    abortion          but federal tax dollar be already not allow to pay for abortion   either in the us or overseas        the hyde amendment currently ban federal funding for abortion in the us   make exception for woman who become pregnant through rape or incest   or whose life would be endanger by the pregnancy        but not for woman who have any other maternal health issue or fetal abnormality     the hyde amendment be a budget rider that have pass every year since        not a permanent law   congress always technically have the option to pass a budget without hyde   but   never actually do so in the    year since hyde be first introduce        republicans in congress want to take that option away   pass hr   would codify the language of the hyde amendment into permanent law     pass the law through the senate would require    vote to break a democratic filibuster        which would be possible   but seem unlikely               push to make hyde permanent be   double down on harmful policy   and disregard the health of    woman and other woman who receive health insurance coverage and care through the federal government     say megan donovan   senior policy manager at the guttmacher institute      as turn out   a lot of people get health insurance through the federal government        federal employee   military service member   incarcerated people   native americans who use indian health service facility   and people who be insure through medicaid        the medicaid ban in particular mean that abortion be already disproportionately unaffordable for poor woman   young woman   and woman of color        all of whom be more likely to need abortion in the first place   about one in six woman of reproductive age rely on medicaid for health insurance   currently      state have a policy to use own state medicaid fund to pay for abortion service        but    percent of woman on medicaid do not live in those state   so can not get any insurance coverage for abortion at all     more than half of those woman who can not get any coverage be woman of color   the bill could also effectively eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion if hr   be pass into law   could   effectively ban   private insurer from cover abortion through plan on the affordable care act exchange   jamila taylor   a senior fellow in woman  s health at the center for american progress   tell vox     to be clear   hr   do not ban abortion coverage directly   instead   give insurer almost no other choice but to stop offer plan on the aca exchange that cover abortion     under hr     woman who buy an insurance plan that cover abortion through the aca exchange will not be able to receive government subsidy   and without those subsidy   buy insurance through the affordable care act be a lot less affordable         if insurance that cover abortion be much more expensive than insurance that do not   most people will choose the cheap option   that would not leave insurance company much incentive to offer abortion coverage at all   even if   technically not prohibit by law     about half of all us state already restrict abortion coverage on aca exchange   hr   would extend similar restriction to the other half of the country         clear the goal be to try to eliminate private coverage of abortion entirely     donovan say     despite these impact   private insurance coverage be not get as much focus as the specter of     abortion   in debate over the bill   that may be because hr   be not a new bill   the house have pass version of before   when repeal the aca be not a realistic possibility and gutte through indirect mean be a well approach     now   of course   republicans in congress be actually pursue a full aca repeal   so from a rhetorical standpoint     less important for to talk about the aca than be to rally    base with talk of     abortion   in advance of the march for life that   come up on friday        grassroots advocate have be try to overturn the hyde amendment for year        and have make significant headway             passing hr   would make a lot harder to get rid of the hyde amendment in the future        and that would be a significant blow to the reproductive justice movement       hard to overstate the impact the hyde amendment have have on woman  s access to abortion   even compare with the slew of state restriction on abortion that have pass in the last five year   while some of those law close abortion clinic by the dozen   the hyde amendment be even more sweeping   have make abortion completely unaffordable for million of woman for    year     somewhere along the line   hyde become a point of consensus between    and    politician        a sort of third rail in abortion politic that neither side would touch   become status quo to consider abortion so controversial that   at the very least   there should be   no taxpayer funding   for   even    lawmaker   when fight against effort to defund planned parenthood   may quickly point out that the organization can not use tax dollar for abortion because hyde be   the law of the land     in recent year   however   grassroots activist have be push hard to repeal hyde   organizing effort lead by woman of color have start to shift the conversation around hyde from be about tax dollar and shame to be about basic fairness and dignity     that   a big reason why the democratic party platform include a call to repeal the hyde amendment for the first time in        and why a bill to repeal hyde be introduce in congress for the first time in          polling also suggest that most americans would be just fine with repeal hyde   a survey conduct by hart research for all above all   the grassroot coalition push to repeal hyde   be strike   large majority of voter   even republicans   in battleground state agree with the statement     however feel about abortion   politician should not be allow to deny a woman  s health coverage for just because   poor     black voter be by far the most supportive of this sentiment   and a majority of those poll      percent   say would support a law require medicaid to cover abortion       the hyde amendment leave many poor woman with no   choice   at all              the hyde amendment make incredibly difficult   if not impossible   for a    woman to actually exercise right to an abortion   hyde mean that woman on medicaid have to pay a median     cost of       for an abortion        which be about a third of monthly income for most of these woman       of the woman who report that medicaid be not pay for abortion   most be already    or   say sarah roberts   a public health social scientist at advance new standards in reproductive health   ansirh       skip meal   or be unable to pay rent or mortgage         woman will go to great length to get an abortion     say diane    an abortion provider and an advocacy fellow with physicians for reproductive health     but can not get blood from a stone   if somebody do not have the money   do not have the money     that   why many advocate see the hyde amendment as   discrimination   pure and simple        say       discrimination against woman who be poor   against people who be already struggle to survive and make end meet     the human cost of ban public abortion funding can be devastating               provide abortion in both maryland   where medicaid can cover abortion   and the district of columbia   where can not   the difference between the two   say   be   night and day         a lot of people do not even know     say     be shocked   be floor   to find out that medicaid do not cover abortion   because cover everything else   and friend in maryland can use medicaid   be blow away         sometimes woman delay the procedure in order to have enough time to scrape the money together   but if delay long enough   may need to have a more expensive and risky procedure       from a purely public health perspective   make sense to help woman get the abortion as early as possible     say dan grossman   director of ansirh     funding restriction can end up have a negative health impact     and woman who become pregnant by an abusive partner and can not get an abortion will   often find even further trap in the cycle of abuse   so   no wonder that not be able to afford the procedure may drive some woman to desperation   include try to give an abortion at home   when researcher interview woman who have try to    an abortion   many of mention cost as a reason for do so      woman who become pregnant by an abusive partner and can not get an abortion will   often find even further trap in the cycle of abuse that   why shortly after the hyde amendment pass   grassroots abortion right advocate start create abortion fund        organization that raise fund   give ride   watch child      percent of woman who have abortion be already mother   and provide other service for woman who need abortion but can not afford   today      of these group in    state be organize under the banner of the national network of abortion funds   nnaf       but abortion fund   while provide a lifeline for many woman in need   can not come close to fill the funding gap   nnaf get about           call a year from woman seek financial assistance for an abortion   executive director yamani hernandez say        and can only fulfill about a third of those request   with an average grant of       per woman   meanwhile   there be    million woman who be subject to hyde and other funding restriction in america           thank goodness abortion access fund be there   but have get limited resource and be unable to help all the client who call        say     should not have to crowdfund somebody  s medical care   that should not be a thing         woman be not the only one who suffer from hyde      say   provide abortion in a hospital   and several time a week see patient who have   devastating   prenatal diagnosis   where the pregnancy be want but the fetus will likely not survive        and where insurance will not cover a termination because of the hyde amendment   these tend to be later procedure   which can cost            to              abortion funding organization usually can not cover expense that high       should not have to crowdfund somebody  s medical care   some of these patient be attorney or analyst who have    government job        but because be federal employee   hyde affect       these be people who have fantastic insurance   or so think        say     and come in and say     well   what do mean   insurance will not cover this   baby will die   be say just have to continue the pregnancy and wait for that to happen     and have to say   yeah   that   exactly what that mean   feel heartless   feel uncaring     to put somebody through a doom pregnancy when do not want to continue   and worry about the baby be bear and experience pain          devastating for everybody involve   and make feel really angry at the people in the office who be make these law   who do not sit with these family and know what feel like     there be exception to the hyde amendment   but be extremely limited and do not cover fetal anomaly   also do not cover risk to a woman  s health that fall short of death        and that put doctor in a terrible position          how do decide when someone be close enough to death to say that deserve to have a pregnancy termination        say     from a clinician  s point of view   there   no   death checklist     where say   well   if have this and this but not this   then be not close enough        want to catch thing before thing get really bad and someone be at death  s door     all of this        the health impact   the economic impact   the social justice impact        be why activist have be push so hard to repeal hyde     in just the three year since the all above all campaign go public   repeal hyde have go from a taboo subject to a mainstream    position officially embrace by the democratic party     an issue that   unlikely to go away quietly   even under an      administration and a republican congress      watch   why     birth control be so necessary

the big decision of entire presidency   choose a replacement for late supreme court justice antonin scalia   trump be now say will announce a pick next week       after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell successfully obstruct president obama  s nominee   merrick garland   for nearly a year   the court be still short a member   a vacancy that trump and ally in the senate be eager to fill quickly   in may   trump release a list of    possible choice for the slot   before add    more in september   as an effort to signal reliability to conservative   promise would make choice only from the name on these list   now   politico  s eliana johnson and shane goldmacher report that trump have narrow the choice to three   all of whom be on federal appeal court     neil gorsuch        of the   th circuit court of appeals   which cover colorado   kansas   new mexico   utah   wyoming   and oklahoma   thomas hardiman        of the third circuit court of appeals   which cover delaware   new jersey   and pennsylvania   william   bill   pryor        of the   th circuit court of appeals   which cover alabama   georgia   and florida     johnson and goldmacher report that gorsuch and hardiman have an advantage and pryor  s chance have wane       all three finalist be white man appoint to post by george w  bush   but vary in background and in how contention nomination would likely be   here   a rundown of what each choice would mean       neil gorsuch             while trump  s list include more graduate of state school and few ivy league grad than most supreme court shortlist   gorsuch be exactly the kind of    figure who   traditionally make onto the court   a graduate of columbia   where be a truman scholar   oxford   where get a doctorate as a marshall scholar   and harvard law   which five other member of the court attend   gorsuch clerk on the dc circuit and then for both justices byron white and anthony kennedy   but gorsuch be also more outspoken and forthright in position than typical supreme court aspirant   write a full book on assist suicide and euthanasia that   while fairly recap both side   come down decisively against   argue that   human life be fundamentally and inherently valuable   and that the intentional taking of human life by private person be always wrong       not hard to infer what that imply for gorsuch  s attitude on abortion         reliably   though idiosyncratically   conservative on a number of other issue as well   a former law clerk describe as have a   deep commitment to the original understanding of the constitution and the rule of law     gorsuch deliver a speech after scalia  s death   an event which state move to tear   praise possible predecessor for understand the distinction between judge and legislator   and for strive not to use the court to make law   appear to believe obamacare  s birth control mandate be unconstitutional on religious liberty ground   have take a limited view of a defendant  s right to competent representation   intriguingly     suggest that think chevron v  nrdc   a foundational decision in administrative law that give regulatory agency broad deference in determine rule   be wrongly decide   that could give plaintiff        whether be business want laxer rule or advocacy group want tough one        more say in the rulemaking process   but   also suggest more sympathy for criminal

from lawsuit   and   express concern with overcriminalization   say that state and the federal government have enact too many statute forbid too much activity       thomas hardiman             trump have be know to say that   the police in country do not get respect     that be assuredly not thomas hardiman  s fault   on the third circuit   hardiman have consistently side with law enforcement against defendant and inmate   rule that a policy of    jail inmate do not violate the fourth amendment  s protection against unreasonable search   an opinion the supreme court uphold       also write   in dissent   that the first amendment do not give citizen the right to tape police        something with which every state in the union currently disagree   hardiman  s    career be full of the kind of thing liberal and democrats do not like   donate to republican candidate before be appoint to the bench   something that be neither illegal nor   to most legal expert   a big deal   and represent plenty of political client and political case while be in private practice   most of this be insignificant   just like   a defense lawyer  s job to defend murderer     a civil lawyer  s job to defend company accuse of discrimination   but   ironic that one of hardiman  s most    case be a housing discrimination suit against a company accuse of conspire to keep out    client        give that the president who may appoint to the supreme court   early in own career   settle a housing discrimination suit of own against the federal government   william pryor             pryor have be on trump  s shortlist at least since the february    gop presidential debate   where come up as an example of the kind of justice trump would like to appoint   pryor        probably have the big national profile of anyone on this list due to star role in the      showdown between president bush and senate democrats over judicial appointment   be initially nominate in      and face fierce opposition for unusually strident and blunt recitation of conservative dogma   ask about a statement make call roe v  wade   the bad abomination in the history of constitutional law     pryor say     stand by that

130226,195886,"The new lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of violating the Constitution, explained",Vox,Libby Nelson,2017/1/24,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/24/14358654/trump-lawsuit-emoluments-clause-constitution,  the first week of president donald trump  s new administration start with a lawsuit claim   already violate the constitution       the lawsuit   file by a collection of    ethic expert and legal scholar   argue that because trump have refuse to give up ownership of hotel and other business     violate a clause of the constitution that prohibit government official from accept gift or payment from foreign government   this provision   know as the emolument clause   be crucial to the debate about trump  s conflict of interest   because   one of the few available tool that may actually be able to force the president to give up business or to hold accountable if do not     some legal expert argue the lawsuit rest on shaky ground because will be hard for the nonprofit that file   citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington   to prove that trump  s action have directly harm   but even if fail   the lawsuit be important     the first   and likely not the last   effort by an alliance of ethic expert and    liberal group to challenge trump on constitutional ground   a victory in court be not the only way these lawsuit can have an effect       the case that trump be violate the constitution president be not legally require to give up business and investment that could be a conflict of interest while be in office   but since richard nixon   all president have   both to try to ensure trust in government and to provide an example for subordinate   who be legally require to eliminate conflict of interest       trump be the exception     claim that will put two adult son   eric trump and donald trump jr  in charge of business while   in office   but make clear that will eventually be return to     hope at the end of eight year   will come back and say   oh   do a good job     say in january   more important   trump have not give up ownership of the business   so if anybody want to put some money in the president  s pocket   all have to do be book a stay at the new trump international hotel in downtown washington   dc   the hotel   which have a sale position dedicate to diplomat   have successfully attract foreign government to book event and room   azerbaijan celebrate hanukkah and bahrain mark national day at the hotel in december   and kuwait be schedule to hold own celebration there in february       this be where the constitution come in   a section know as the emolument clause prohibit any officeholder in the united states from accept any   emolument   title   or office   from a foreign government   an   emolument   be usually define as money or other benefit get from a job or office hold   until trump be elect   the clause   originally a response to benjamin franklin accept a snuffbox from the king of france   be pretty obscure   but the prospect of trump make money off foreign government   booking at hotel or through other business have make a major issue at the start of presidency   trump will continue to profit from business while   in office   and many prominent scholar on the issue argue that as soon as that money start come in   will violate the constitution   the lawsuit provide a long list of potential emolument clause violation   include booking by diplomat at trump hotel and lease in trump tower   global royalty from the apprentice   which be show on    television network in some country   and permit issue by foreign government for    or    business in those country       the lawsuit ask the court to declare that trump be in violation of the emolument clause   even if be   though   would be up to congress to decide whether that merit impeach and remove from office        and republicans in congress so far have be reluctant to look into trump  s break with tradition on ethical issue   trump  s official position be that the emolument clause do not apply to   sheri dillon   a partner at the washington law firm morgan lewis   bockius   lay this argument out at a january    press conference     pay for a hotel room be not a gift or a present   and have nothing to do with an office     not an emolument     trump plan to avoid the issue   dillon go on to say   by donate profit make from foreign stay at hotel to the federal government   but even if trump follow through on this promise   will not alleviate concern from former chief white house ethic lawyer and the head of the federal office of government ethics   who maintain that the only ethical solution be for trump to sell business and let an outsider manage the proceed   the big question   can crew sue trump at all                the lawsuit allege that trump violate the emolument clause be file by some of the nation  s foremost expert on constitutional law   corruption   and government ethic   include laurence tribe   a harvard professor of constitutional law who have also argue    case before the supreme court   zephyr teachout   a fordham university professor who study corruption   and who have run for office twice in new york     and erwin chemerinsky   the dean of the university of california irvine school of law     still   have a high bar to clear in court     not just a question of prove trump violate the constitution   the lawyer must prove client   the center for responsibility and ethics in washington   have be directly injure by what argue be trump  s unconstitutional action   to win a lawsuit   first have to prove that have   stand          that whatever be sue about harm directly in a way that a court can remedy   if a judge decide do not have stand   case will be dismiss   historically   this have be a high hurdle for lawsuit against the president to clear   but not an impossible one       citizen for responsibility and ethics in washington   the plaintiff in the case   argue that have stand because trump  s conflict of interest and possible violation of the emolument clause have be very    for organization   the lawsuit describe crew as besiege by question from the medium about trump  s business interest     answer those question   accord to the lawsuit   take time and resource away from the organization  s other work   include track potential violation of campaign finance law   file comment on propose regulation   and analyze nonprofit   tax form   the supreme court accept this reasoning as stand enough to sue in a fair housing case in        but some legal expert be skeptical   jonathan adler   a professor of law at case western reserve university   explain doubt on twitter on monday      stand claim in   crewvtrump be quite a stretch   if crew have stand here   lujan would have come out the other way        jonathan h  adler    jadler       january               other law professor   many of who   like adler   tend to be conservative   concur   but lawsuit where the argument for standing be initially perceive as questionable at good have succeed in the past     when the house of representatives sue president obama over a provision in obamacare in        argue that obama break the law by give money to insurer that have not be authorize by congress   many legal expert give little chance of succeed because believe speaker of the house john boehner do not have stand to sue   but the us district court for the district of columbia disagree and allow the suit to proceed in        and later rule in boehner  s favor     the case be under appeal     when texas sue over obama  s executive action on immigration that would have protect the parent of    child from deportation   some legal observer   include two american university law professor and former new york times supreme court reporter linda greenhouse   argue that the state have no standing to sue   but texas be allow to proceed with case   which win in appellate court     the supreme court deadlocke    in        uphold the appellate court victory         even if crew be not find to have standing   though   the mere fact that   file the lawsuit be significant   the emolument clause lawsuit could win without win              crew have already challenge the president on at least three front   besides the emolument clause lawsuit   the group send a letter to the general services administration about the lease on trump  s dc hotel   which bar elect official from benefit from the property   on friday   the group sue the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for more information on the trump transition team  s request for the name of scientist work on climate change   and that   just in the first three day of trump  s presidency     this be not a surprise   the chair and vice chair of crew  s board have be two of the most outspoken critic of trump  s conflict of interest   norm eisen   who found crew in        be the chair   and richard painter   george w  bush  s former ethic lawyer   be the vice chair   since the campaign   have become a crusading odd couple of sort   set aside other political difference   painter be a lifelong republican   although vote for hillary clinton   to forcefully and repeatedly decry trump  s refusal to divest of business interest     but there be also good political reason for nonprofit that oppose trump to sue   judicial watch   a conservative watchdog group   have file dozen of lawsuit against the clintons since president bill clinton be in office   in        the group file more than    lawsuit over hillary clinton  s use of a private email server and also obtain email from the state department feature exchange between the clinton foundation and government official   both of those controversy turn out to be pivotal in the      election   in the aftermath of election day   when some democrats argue that liberal need own version of judicial watch   crew be suggest as one group that could step into the role   accord to politico  s josh gerstein   crew be found with a nonpartisan mission   but david brock   a clinton ally and democratic donor   serve as chair for two year        brock spend inauguration weekend at a summit of democratic donor in florida and   accord to politico   describe crew as a group that   likely to be particularly active as the trump administration get underway   even if crew  s case be not all winner in court   the legal process could force the trump administration to divulge information would rather keep secret   eisen hope the emolument clause suit will force trump to release tax return   which   refuse to make public   a win in court be not the only way for the suit to score point    
130227,195887,Trump’s flurry of day one policies had some surprising omissions,Vox,Dara Lind,2017/1/24,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/24/14364238/trump-executive-orders-day-one,  donald trump make a lot of promise on the campaign trail about what would do on day one of presidency   now day one be over        and after the first full weekday of the trump administration   what trump have not do be just as notable as what have       trump  s first round of executive order be surprisingly consistent with what may see from any other republican president   a splashy but vague order on implement obamacare   a federal hiring freeze   and a reinstatement of the   global gag rule     an    funding rule that   exist under past republican administration   trump also formally pull the us out of the    partnership trade deal        which critic say could undermine american effort to play economic hardball with china   on two of trump  s big issue   though        immigration and obamacare repeal and replacement        administration show monday that   still not quite sure what   go to do   at least through executive action   on those issue     day one   do not involve read executive order   just tea leave        the official death of the tpp   or at least the us  s participation in   could be an opening for china the most prominent campaign promise that the trump administration keep on day one be an instruction to the us trade representative  s office   ask to pull the us out of the    partnership   a trade deal among country that border the pacific ocean that the obama administration negotiate but fail to get congress to ratify        the tpp be basically dead anyway   both trump and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton have promise not to pursue   even if trump have    the current congress be certainly not more likely to approve a trade deal than the old congress be   politically   though   the tppullout officially reverse the position of the past several presidential administration that multilateral free trade deal be fundamentally good   the trump administration have promise to support only trade deal that support american job   particularly in the manufacturing sector   and   show a preference for bilateral       trade deal with individual country as oppose to big deal like the tpp   or nafta   which the trump administration have not yet formally ask to renegotiate but be expect to do so soon         may take a little longer to see the consequence of the us  s tpp pullout for policy     possible that the deal will collapse entirely   though some country   like australia   be still hope to ratify     because the tpp be devise   in part   to counter china  s grow dominance in southeast asia   by create tight economic tie between those country and the us   may be logical to assume that the us  s absence from the tpp would be good for china   that   especially true because china have be cast lately as a defender of globalization   in contrast to the populist turn in the us and europe       what   good for china may not be bad for the us        there   a good argument to be make that be not   in fact   but the trump administration appear to believe that chinese economic dominance be   in fact   very bad for the us   and have all but promise to get very aggressive with china on trade     go to be hard to weaken china economically without compete with in southeast asia       kill the global gag rule will probably lead to more abortion worldwide president trump do not make abortion a key campaign issue   and barely mention reinstate the mexico city policy   often refer to by    advocate as the global gag rule          a policy date back to the reagan administration   which govern us funding for international health effort   but   a standard policy for a republican president   at this point   and a key ask of the    organization that still hold down the party  s    wing   so on day one   the gag go back on                the global gag rule   contrary to what trump administration official and    group have say   do not prevent us taxpayer money from go to fund abortion abroad        that be not happen to begin with   here   what do   as explain by vox  s emily crockett   the rule strip federal funding from international organization that either provide abortion or discuss abortion service with client        even if those service be pay for by separate   privately raise fund            the gag rule try to control how international organization use own fund   raise from other source   defund entire organization if those organization        many of which also provide contraception and other health care to vulnerable woman worldwide        do so much as tell woman that abortion be a family planning option   this policy make sense for people who do not want the united states to do anything that could be in any way construe as support abortion   but datum from the last time the policy be instate   under george w  bush   suggest that        in addition to hurt other public health aim   like    prevention        actually lead to an increase in abortion      ssa country more reliant on usaid for reproductive health see big rise in abortion after      global gag rule https         pic   twitter          charles kenny    charlesjkenny   january               nongovernmental organization also estimate that since those abortion be more likely to be unsafe   the mexico city policy could also cause maternal mortality to go up   so the global gag rule be best understand as an endorsement of intention versus consequence   a declaration that the us be not go to be involve in anything that consider abortion a legitimate exercise   rather than a commitment to reduce abortion   a hire freeze base on a lie        and with some big question mark attach trump  s third executive order monday institute a hiring freeze throughout the federal government   claim to halt a   dramatic increase   in the size of the federal workforce under president barack obama     there have be no such increase         the freeze have two big loophole        one much clear than the other   the clear exemption be for the military   the less clear one   any job deem   necessary to meet natsec or public safety responsibility   can be fill   but the freeze do not specify who else would count under that umbrella   this may get messy   the executive order say   the job of the head of an agency to determine who count as   necessary     but the trump administration still have not nominate people to run most of the agency        mean the decision could be up to act agency head   hold over from obama   or could just pile up unaddressed     the office of management and budget be also allow to grant exemption   but trump  s nominee for that have not be confirm     in the past   hire freeze have not tend to work to shrink the federal government        not least because much of the federal workforce be actually take up by contractor   who be often less    but do not count as permanent   job     but the hire freeze could make hard for some federal agency to keep up with workload        especially give how understaffed at top level the trump administration be likely to be for the first several month   what happen to trump  s immigration promise   perhaps the big surprise monday be that when end   the trump administration  s immigration policy be publicly identical to the obama administration  s        no change have be make   or at least announce       furthermore   when come to deportation   the trump administration be sound mighty                ask about rumor that president trump will end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program        the    program that   give protection from deportation and work permit to about           unauthorized immigrant        white house press secretary sean spicer say that trump   have be clear that need to direct agency to focus on those who be in the country illegally with a criminal record    pose a threat   to americans   that   exactly the policy the obama administration spend several year try to impose on immigration agent in the field        over the vocal objection   and sustain resistance   of those field agent   trump win the support of the union represent immigration agent by promise would no longer be restrict in do job   the trump administration could have issue executive action rescind the    memo that direct immigration agent on which unauthorized immigrant should not be   priority   for deportation     the house freedom caucus have recommend do just that     have not yet   obama  s direction be still in place   and trump  s press secretary be now endorse something very much like   on the daca program        despite persistent rumor that trump be act imminently to end the program        at least some member of the trump administration appear content to let daca remain in place for now   white house chief of staff reince priebus   ask about an executive order on fox news sunday   say the administration be   go to work with house and senate leadership as well to get a    solution     meanwhile   the federal government have continue to process application for the program                there be likely to be    executive order later in the week   though no one   yet sure exactly what topic will cover     more likely that trump will issue some sort of executive order   authorize   work on a wall on the    border   or restrict federal grant to   sanctuary city     than that will take on the daca program in week one       an obamacare executive order that do not make much sense without a cabinet secretary to interpret trump  s first executive action   direct the federal government to waive enforcement of the affordable care act   to the maximum extent permit by law     be actually issue friday night   but as of monday   no one be totally sure what would mean        because there be not yet a secretary of the department of health and human services to interpret the order and turn into policy     rep  tom price   trump  s nominee   have not yet be confirm     vox  s sarah kliff think this vagueness may end up have policy effect     if be an insurance plan   for example   the executive order say that have no clue about the regulatory landscape around the health care law in the coming month and year   if that   the case   why bother stick around and sell coverage   why not get out now   the executive order make no tangible change   but introduction of more uncertainty may very well do that       possible   though   that once price be confirm to the hhs secretary position will choose to interpret the executive order aggressively   the trump administration could even decide to stop enforce the individual mandate   as adviser kellyanne conway   who do not have an official position in the administration   hint could happen in an interview monday   the trump administration would probably face some sort of court challenge if try to just stop enforce the mandate   but as kliff point out   the obama administration delay implementation of some part of the aca   so there may be precedent for the trump administration to halt   this would be a huge disruption to the aca        and   indeed   the whole health care system as exist right now     halt implementation of the individual mandate could cause really significant disruption in some state marketplace     kliff write     encourage both healthy individual and health insurer to quit the marketplace     the result would be a health insurance market that only sick people participate in        mean high rate for participant and less coverage for everyone     possible that some state could try to impose own mandate        but    state be unlikely to find this an appealing option     watch   republicans have one major problem on obamacare     
130228,195888,What Trump’s executive orders on Dakota Access and Keystone XL actually do,Vox,Brad Plumer,2017/1/24,2017.0,1.0,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/1/24/14372706/trump-dakota-access-keystone,  on tuesday   president trump sign two executive order intend to revive the dakota access and keystone xl pipeline        two controversial oil project that have be halt under president obama after year of grassroots protest and fierce opposition from climate activist       while nothing   final until the pipeline be actually build   these order make approval much more likely   trump have make support the oil and gas industry a key priority of presidency   and this be first big policy move toward that end   so let take each project in turn   to see what these executive order actually do       the dakota access pipeline still face a review from the army corps             the dakota access pipeline be a     pipeline that would ship           barrel of oil per day from the bakken field in north dakota to a shipping terminal in illinois     about    percent complete   save for a portion near the standing rock reservation in north dakota   for month   the standing rock sioux and other activist have be protest construction there   argue that the pipeline could endanger both nearby water supply and sacred site       the army corps of engineers have originally approve the pipeline  s route near the reservation   but the standing rock sioux file a lawsuit over this decision   claim that the tribe be not properly consult   in late        the obama administration order the army corps to reconsider decision   and in december the agency announce that would also explore alternative pipeline route further away from the reservation   this would require a lengthy environmental review        and mean a big delay for dakota access       currently   the army corps be prepare an environmental impact statement   eis   which mean explore different potential route for the pipeline   solicit public comment   and so on        a complex legal process that could take a year or more   in executive order today   trump tell the army corps to hurry up   first   suggest that the agency may want to   rescind or modify   decision to consider alternate route   also tell the army corps to   take all action necessary and appropriate   to review and approve the pipeline   in an expedited manner      to the extent permit by law and as warrant          so what happen next   that   really up to the army corps   explain sharon buccino   an attorney and director of the land and wildlife program at the natural resources defense council   the army corps could decide to continue with eis anyway   take time to explore alternate route   or the agency could read trump  s order and decide that an eis be not require   after all        and hence rush to approve the route that pass near the reservation   if the latter happen   the standing rock sioux and environmental group would almost certainly try to challenge the decision in the dc circuit court   if the former happen   and army corps carry out exploration of alternative route   will eventually have to decide which route to approve        a decision that would have to be ground in the fact of the eis   ultimately   that decision would be make by the assistant secretary of the army for civil works and the us army corps of engineers        a political position that will presumably be fill by trump     bottom line   some sort of approval of the pipeline look very likely   the big question be what route the army corps settle on and how long the agency take to decide   trump be pressure to figure thing out sooner rather than later       in a statement   dave archambault ii   chair of the standing rock sioux   urge the trump administration to let the eis play out     president trump be legally require to honor treaty right and provide a fair and reasonable pipeline process        the exist pipeline route risk infringing on treaty right   contaminate water and the water of    million americans downstream     shortly before trump issue the order   the standing rock sioux ask protester to leave the site where be protest pipeline construction   note that need time to clean the area of debris before spring flooding begin     unclear if protest could resume around standing rock in light of this new order       trump be invite transcanada to renew application for keystone xl             the keystone xl pipeline   meanwhile   be a propose    pipeline between hardisty   canada   and steele city   nebraska   that would be build by a canadian firm call transcanada   would carry up to           barrel of oil per day        mostly from alberta  s oil sand   but also some from north dakota   this pipeline become a major flash point for climate activist during the obama administration        and obama eventually reject transcanada  s application   rule that the project be not in the national interest     because the pipeline cross national border   the state department have a major say in the project     among other thing   obama argue that the project   which would help bolster oil sand production in canada   would undercut america  s   global leadership   on climate change   trump   obviously   have no such concern   so on tuesday   sign an executive order that invite transcanada to resubmit application for the keystone xl pipeline   also order the state department to   take all action necessary and appropriate to facilitate expeditious review          and reach a decision in no later than    day   on tuesday afternoon   transcanada say be prepare a fresh application for keystone xl   environmentalist denounce the decision   though have far less leverage to block the pipeline this time around than do under obama   note that transcanada will have to get a number of additional permit from the army corps and department of interior to finish the pipeline   and opponent could try to challenge the project there        but this be an uphill battle       trump also want to study how to build pipeline use only us steel there   one last odd twist   during the signing   trump tell reporter would   renegotiate some of the term   of keystone xl        possibly with an insistence that transcanada only use american steel     that would be a problem for the company   only about    percent of the keystone xl pipe supplier be american   with the rest come from canada   india   and italy     but there   nothing in the executive order about negotiating term        and later on   trump  s press secretary sean spicer say the president just want the pipeline approve   so this   renegotiating   bit seem to be just empty talk   trump do   however   sign a third executive order on tuesday order the secretary of commerce to develop a plan within     day in which all new and upgraded pipeline inside the united states   use material and equipment produce in the united states   to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permit by law       unclear how this would be at all compatible with wto rule   but will see what the study say   also sign two other order intend to speed up environmental review of infrastructure project     unclear how much practical effect those order will have   read darryl fears   breakdown for more on that     watch   the fight over the dakota access pipeline

jar introduction to the new trump administration   and come in for a good deal of condemnation from reporter and mockery from observer of all political stripe   a hashtag call   seanspicerfact   in which picture of spicer at the briefing be post alongside humorous false claim   trend on twitter   two day later   when be push at monday  s first full press briefing   spicer say be   not   say trump have the large    inaugural crowd   indeed   argue that have never make such a claim   say that be only refer to the combine    tv   and stream global audience as the large   this claim about the total audience be also quite questionable   and as the weekly standard  s michael warren archly observe     why take spicer two day to make this clarification be not clear     but the shift seem sufficient to satisfy many reporter   many of whom publicly praise spicer  s performance monday       at heart   this squabble about crowd size may not seem particularly consequential   but this    have broad implication for how the new trump administration be shape up        in how will deal with the press   in whether can be trust to provide basic factual information   and in just how hard the press corps be go to push back            who be sean spicer   a longtime republican operative   spicer hold a series of press job for congressional republicans and then in the us trade representative  s office of george w  bush  s administration   which   give the bush administration  s policy   mean be often argue that big trade deal be wonderful     eventually become communication director of the republican national committee   and while work there   rnc chair reince priebus make the crucial decision to cooperate with trump  s victory in the      primary rather than mobilize the party to try to stop at the convention or beforehand   so priebus  s rnc end up a valuable ally to trump  s team   that include spicer   who become a tireless advocate for trump in the press   when the

team alongside longtime trump loyalist jason miller   communication director   and hope hicks   strategic communication director     however   when miller decide not to take the communication director job due to an apparent sex scandal   spicer be hand job too     traditionally   the white house press secretary be the president  s main spokesperson and representative   with the responsibility of deal with the press on a     basis   and often get grill by reporter     meanwhile   the communication director be usually a separate aide in charge of the    strategizing about how the president can get message out through the medium and to the american people   since spicer have both job   though   be the top press staffer in the white house        on paper   at least           what do sean spicer do this weekend               on saturday afternoon        the first full day of the trump administration        spicer call reporter to the white house briefing room to deliver a statement denounce the medium     spicer first complain about a time magazine reporter  s inaccurate statement from friday night that trump have remove a bust of martin luther king jr  from the oval office     the reporter quickly admit be mistaken and apologize     spicer call the reporter   irresponsible and reckless     then   spicer move on to the main event        make the case   at length   that the medium be try to   lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration   by understate the size of trump  s crowd   bolster a case trump have make in a speech to cia employee a few hour earlier       spicer argue that   this be the first time in nation  s history that floor covering have be use to protect the grass on the mall     which   have the effect of highlight any area where people be not stand

be not actually use and quote a law enforcement source say be   not aware of any issue   with crowd flow     and make the inaccurate claim that           people use the dc metro on inauguration day and only           use for obama  s      inauguration     in fact   metro say           trip be take for obama  s full inauguration day that year and only           for trump  s       finally   spicer sum thing up with a statement that immediately become iconic     this be the large audience to ever witness an inauguration   period   both in person and around the globe         how do this go over   photo compare trump  s inauguration turnout with obama  s in      be everywhere on social medium friday   and prove to anyone with eye that   as far as the    number go   trump  s turnout be not even close to obama  s   the    of spicer  s specific claim quickly pour in too   naturally   then   condemnation and mockery pour in from both side of the political aisle   george w  bush  s first white

always lie   though   white house press secretary from both party have a long and noble tradition of mislead the press   job frequently involve put the good possible gloss on condition in the country or the world   explain away apparent scandal   or portray the president  s policy agenda in a very rosy light   but spin be consider a sort of game of skill in washington   the most skillful practitioner of this art be able to push prefer message or gloss on event to reporter without rely on obvious   provable lie   indeed   some reporter who have to work closely with these press aide even grow to admire for bullshit ability   furthermore   must be say that there be inevitably many time in which the white house spinner have a point   reporter can get bad tip   could be miss exculpatory information or important context   or could simply mess up   as the time reporter do with the mlk bust     at time like these     good for everyone involve if the white house can put corrective factual information out there and be believe when do so     in order to do the job of the press secretary right   have always get to reflect the president but keep the respect of the press     say fleischer   who be the first white house press secretary for george w  bush     do not have to agree with all the time   but can clash respectfully if can articulately speak for the president and know what be talk about   and should always be truthful in all matter     but overall   spicer  s mistake be not in say something misleading        that   consider perfectly acceptable by many in the dc journalism community   mistake be not even in say something flatly false   since policy be complex and political aide   false statement about policy be often cover    by reporter who be not particularly verse in policy detail       instead   spicer  s blunder be say something that could so easily be prove false with something as simple a mere picture   that break the rule   and reporter feel insult intelligence   so when dial back spin to the   usual   level on monday   many white house reporter be much happy with performance   fleischer   too   have kind word for spicer  s monday show and think bode well for tenure in the office     think sean do excellent today   be     demonstrate a real knowledge of what the president be think   demonstrate a real command of policy   and recover saturday  s fumble and run forward     and   add     sean  s tone be pitch perfect   be tough   be aggressive   but be respectful         why do spicer do this               the obvious reason   of course   be that boss   president donald trump   want to   be notable   for instance   that spicer read statement word for word rather than speak off the cuff and also bring visual aids   suggest that this be pretty carefully plan behind the scene   during the campaign   trump complain repeatedly that the medium allegedly would not cover enormous crowd   be common for to exaggerate   for instance   how many people be stick wait outside because of meddle fire marshal   these claim often bear no resemblance to reality   but trump seem acutely interested in portray as wildly popular     and that have clearly carry over into the white house   trump grow increasingly annoy at the coverage of crowd size throughout the day saturday   accord to source close to interview by the new york times   washington post   and politico   since trump be not particularly know for poker face   this spill over into public during remark to cia employee earlier saturday   when complain about this topic and claim that   to     look like a million and a half people     other big name in the trump administration get in the game too   with   for instance   white house counselor kellyanne conway claim in a television appearance sunday that spicer be merely present   alternative fact     and priebus claim the medium be try to delegitimize trump  s presidency       still   spicer  s statement particularly stand out for be so easily debunk   and interestingly   other in the trump administration seem to agree        or at least take advantage of the opportunity to shiv a rival   and a priebus ally   in the press   anonymous   people familiar with mr  trump  s thinking   soon leak to the new york times that the president think spicer   go too far     and new york magazine  s gabriel sherman tweet that accord to a longtime trump adviser   the president say that spicer  s statement   be terrible           what   the big picture here   as be so often   the big picture be about new president   donald trump   trump have a complex and fraught relationship with the mainstream medium   during the campaign   greatly benefit from the sheer volume of press coverage get   but believe many member of the mainstream medium be bias against   and let be honest     unlikely that many of these primarily coastal city dweller be trump fan     yet also seem to frequently watch tv and   if feel aggrieve or inspire by what   watch at a particular moment   to tweet about or react to in some way   if this controversy be any indication   become the most powerful man in the world have not change any of this   now   inauguration crowd size be an inconsequential issue   but as j  m  berger argue   currently rely on the government for a great deal of factual and statistical information     if be enter a brave new world of government assault on consensus reality   that will have    consequence not yet obvious     berger tweet   by deny the inaugural crowd size   some fear that trump seek to create a parallel information universe for supporter   where would simply trust instead of the medium   and then there   the medium  s own reaction   when many journalist condemn spicer on saturday and praise on monday   be send the message that be not in some orwellian dictatorship where the trump administration can deny what   indisputably true   what trump  s aide need to do   essentially signal   be frame denial and craft spin in a way that   hard to outright deny   then thing will be normal once again     watch   sean spicer  s claim in first press brief

what would expect   some good nomination here   some surprise snub there   two random nomination for the truly awful passengers way over there     grant   both of those passenger nomination        production design and original score        be for the film  s technical element   but still   that movie should be jettison into space               related     here   the complete list of      oscar nominee   overall   though     a good list   one that showcase the breadth and diversity of film make in        directly address the   oscarssowhite controversy over the lack of act nominee of color from the past two year   then throw in nominee of color in several other major category   and both tie and break some longstanding oscar record   here be the winner and loser from oscar nomination morning        winner   la la land tie the big record of all with    nomination   the musical la la land join a very elite group   only       s all about eve and       s titanic have attain the same number of nomination   and both go on to win good picture   along with several other award     titanic   in fact   be one of just three movie to win    oscars          la la land be nominate for actor   for screenplay   for every technical category other than visual effect   which would not have make sense anyway     for direction   and   of course   for good picture             related     la la land see old hollywood magic give way to modern melancholy   this be pretty much the    scenario for la la land   which be not really a contender in any other category   like the support actor race   achieve this kind of oscar success depend on a variety of factor   from a year without a lot of big   flashy contender to a film that check every box on the list of thing the oscars love   fortunately for la la land        be just such a year   and there   nothing the oscars love more than bittersweet paean to hollywood magic   winner   actually   every good picture nominee do pretty well for              sure   there be some weird snub here and there   nomination that various good picture nominee could have snag but miss out on   but for the most part   the    good picture lineup boast a healthy number of nomination across the board       the least nominate of the nine be hidden figures   which pick up three in total   but all in    category   from there   both fences and hell or high water receive four nomination each   mostly in the top eight category   lion   hacksaw ridge   and manchester by the sea all receive six apiece   and both arrival and moonlight manage eight nomination each   which be close to ceiling   occasionally   a best picture nominee will sneak in seemingly because one branch of the academy   usually the actor   really   really love the movie   but every nominee this year boast    support from various group throughout the academy   these be movie hollywood really love        for well or bad   loser   silence never take off for much of the prestige movie season   martin scorsese  s religious drama silence be the    gorilla wait in the wing   the director be an oscar favorite   the film be passion project   and when critic finally see   review be kind to glowing   sure   the movie be a box office disappointment   but that do not always matter with more cerebral film like this one   as far as the oscars be concern             related     silence be beautiful   unsettling   and one of the fine religious movie ever make   but the film struggle to land key nomination at various industry award   miss out on nod from the directors guild   the screen actors guild   and many other   good hope be that late release date        christmas day        mean that oscar voter would catch up to a little later on and justly reward   but           nah   silence receive one nomination for cinematography   and while cinematography be gorgeous   the movie surely deserve better   winner     oscarssowhite be not nearly as vital in      in      and        zero actor of color be nominate for oscars   zero director of color be nominate   of the two year   good picture lineup   only the martin luther king jr  drama selma be drive by the story of people of color   and that film receive just two nomination   in response   activist april reign create a quickly viral hashtag     oscarssowhite   the academy   fumble toward damage control   institute a variety of sweeping rule change and attempt to diversify membership   in        the hashtag be less vital   to be sure   most of the oscar nominee be still white   include    of the act nominee   but the other seven include six black actor and one actor of indian descent   barry jenkins be nominate for best director   and the technical category include numerous nominee of color   include arrival  s bradford young   only the second black cinematographer to ever be nominate       and fully four of the nine good picture nominee        fence   hidden figures   lion   and moonlight        be about people of color   be   oscarssowhite responsible for the sudden diversity of this list of nominee   in the sense that spur change at the academy   yes   but what   most important here be that hollywood make these film   be all in    genre        moonlight be a     story   hidden figures be a historical drama   fences be a stage adaptation   and lion be a    tearjerker        but be also all about people of color   as recently as last year   that just be not happen        the push for well diversity and representation in hollywood continue to move more slowly than should   but in        appear to have bear some fruit   loser   pixar miss out on the animated feature category              to be fair   pixar have miss out on the animated feature category before   car   be not nominate in        but be also the studio  s    film   monsters university be not nominate in        a competitive year   and when the good dinosaur be not nominate in        be because pixar  s own inside out be take up a spot   but finding dory be a huge hit with terrific review   yes   be a sequel to finding nemo   and if nothing else   pixar  s miss illustrate that the academy be a bit reticent toward the studio  s sequel   have nominate only toy story   in        but pixar be still a major heavyweight in this category   and finding dory have be nominate at most precursor award   at the same time   dory be fine   sure   but be well than the competition   in a brutally competitive year in this category   one in which fellow snub film like name and april and the extraordinary world could well have be nominate   be just too much   pixar will have to be content with animated short nomination for piper   loser   amy adams somehow miss good actress yes   this be an    year for best actress   and   yes   amy adams miss because of the surprise strength of loving  s ruth negga   who give a lovely   understated performance in a movie that receive no other nomination   but still   adams give one of the good performance of the year as a linguist try to connect with alien in arrival   be nominate at most major precursor award   film receive eight nomination total   the movie become a significant hit   largely on shoulder          really   really strange be not nominate   be all be say   too bad   amy adams     winner   meryl streep receive   th nomination meryl streep be now the first person ever to receive    oscar nomination for act   close competitor        katherine hepburn and jack nicholson        have just    nomination each     the record streep set by be nominate for florence foster jenkins   but really for give an    trump speech at the golden globes   let be honest here   seem unlikely to be break for many   many year        if ever     amy adams should have be nominate instead   though   know   true     loser   big studio film flame out              the best picture list have a decidedly independent hue for yet another year        a descriptor that   really true head all the way back to the     s   sure   arrival be distribute by paramount   but be entirely independently fund   with paramount pick up at the last minute   hidden figures be a   th century fox film   and fences   like arrival   see some of bill foot by paramount   but far from all of   beyond that   though   the top eight category be full of movie make by mini major   like lionsgate   which be behind la la land and hacksaw ridge   and     indie studio like a     moonlight   and amazon studios   manchester by the sea     hell   the studio behind hell or high water        cbs films        be better associate with television       as mention   this be where the industry have be trend for a very   very long time   but there   usually one or two major big studio competitor among the good picture lineup   just last year   mad max   fury road   from warner bros    win the most oscars of any film nominate   and the revenant   from fox   be close behind     that simply can not happen this year   since hidden figures   the only unambiguous    film in the bunch   be nominate for just three award   the delineation between   big studio make big dumb franchise movie   and   other studio make artistically interesting film   have rarely seem so stark   and yet          winner   this be a pretty good year at the good picture box office there be more big hit last year        the revenant   the martian   and mad max all surpass       million domestic in the end   but what   impressive this year be the number of film that have make solid money for weight class     start at the top   both hidden figures and la la land look like bona fide hit   both have earn more than      million domestically so far   with plenty of time leave in respective run   and will be surprising if both do not find a way to make to       million domestic   then look at arrival   which have not quite make to       million     in the      million range   but should get there with this extra attention   and hacksaw ridge have a healthy run   bring in more than      million domestically   but even the small film beat expectation   fence be very nearly at      million        impressive for a stage adaptation   manchester by the sea could get to      million as well   while moonlight should get to      million   which be great for such an artistic movie that  s also light on story   really   only lion   which be just over      million   feel like an underperformer     the kind of    film that should be able to pull in double that amount   if not far more   winner      drama find a warm oscar embrace              alongside the usual    tale   the oscars find room for a handful of film set right in the middle of rural america        which be not always the case

130231,195891,NAFTA and other trade deals have not gutted American manufacturing — period,Vox,J.

international trade agreement in        all politician seek to win a national election   or even to create a    political coalition   agree that trade agreement be bad thing       from the left   have democratic presidential primary    bernie sanders        and a remarkably close    be        slam trade   from the        do not think   wrong but   not quite correct to call   right     at least not as americans have hitherto understand what   right   be        but from somewhere   have    donald trump   listen to   the rhetoric be the same   go like this   the job america want to have        the good job   the manufacturing job        have go   first come nafta   in        then there be china  s entry into the world trade organization   which grant china a normal country  s freedom to export to other country   and obligation to accept import from other country   finally   there be the       and   as of this week   officially dead      partnership   tpp       such agreement will leave   or have leave     million of worker with nothing but poverty and heartache     trump   have   lose               manufacturing job     trump   and create   catastrophe     trump     the agreement amount to   the death blow for american manufacturing     sander     undermine independence     trump   and   force american worker to compete against desperate and    labor around the world     sander   all while cause   massive job loss in the united states and the shutting down of ten of thousand of factory     sander         and what do hear from the center establishment   have popular vote     win   but electoral college     lose   democratic party presidential nominee hillary rodham clinton   state     will stop any trade deal that kill job or hold down wage   include the    partnership   oppose now   will oppose after the election   and will oppose as president                  the rhetoric of all three candidate resonate with the criticism of trade agreement that hear way back when nafta be on the table as a proposal        not   as today   something to blame all current economic woe on   the independent ross perot and republican insurgent pat buchanan claim nafta would produce   a giant sucking sound   of job   go south     perot   that have   wreck the country with these kind of deal     perot   that the deal add up to             page of rule   regulation   law   fine   commission        plus side agreement        set up no few than    new bureaucracy     buchanan     the political truthiness have be fly thick and fast on this subject for decade now   politician be take claim that have a very tenuous connection to economic reality        claim that feel true        and run with   sometimes out of ignorance   sometimes because of cynical calculation       trump and sander be apocalyptic in discussion of trade   and then clinton abandon the truth   too clinton be clearly the candidate whose policy claim   as a whole   have the good empirical support   so surrender to truthy proclamation about trade be especially gall   adviser and expert   be certain   do not believe the tpp would kill job or hold down wage   although may have be aware of some of the technocratic economic complaint about the tpp     those complaint   with which sympathize   be twofold   first   that the tpp would have give us owner of intellectual property too much of a whip hand in extraction of economic rent from people in poor country   would have make pay through the nose for research and development that have already be do   and have already be pay for out of profit earn in the us   second   set in stone rule for judge whether government be treat company fairly   do want a trading system in which company export and invest have confidence that will not be specifically discriminate against by government   but the form such rule should take be very delicate     not wise to set in stone before see how work   the general agreement among those who analyze the tpp   however   be that be on the whole very profitable for the us   yes   make poor foreigner pay through the nose for intellectual property   but be definitely not a job killer for the us   or a wage suppressor   and insofar as those who profit from the tpp then turn around and employ worker in the us   which to a great extent would have   would have be a wage and job booster       but for the purpose of the hrc campaign   a job killer and a wage suppressor have to be   and so become   but the truthiness on the subject of trade agreement be fly even thick and faster from the other   from sanders last spring   from trump        and   again   earlier   from perot and buchanan     yes   america have be lose manufacturing job share at a furious rate   yes   the spread between the income of the     and the    have widen massively   yes   the spread between the income of even the    and overclass have explode     but this be not due to nafta   this be not due to bring china into the wto rather than keep out   this be not due to the           and now            tpp                 try to calculate the share that those three   bad trade agreement   play in the process of manufacture job loss   of widen income inequality   and the coming of the overclass of the second gilded age   and        as long as calculate honestly        get a share of responsibility of less than   percent   and usually less than   percent   this be what cause a populist backlash   to defend trade deal be not to say that us economic policy have be without fault to be clear   do think american international economic policy have be far   far from perfect   could rant with the good of about failure to be a    nation finance the industrialization of the world   a role from which would ultimately benefit both economically and politically   can rant about reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of the global treasure that be community of engineering practice   be no accident that spin machine be make in lowell   massachusetts   that automobile be make in detroit   minicomputer be make along route       massachusetts   that program be write in silicon valley   and that hoverboard be make in shenzhen   china   a community of engineer   technician   and business that have see the problem and method of an industry up close and who know how to solve be an incredibly valuable and     economic resource   should not   protect   such community regardless of cost   but should nurture       also believe that a rich country like the us should be save more than invest here at home   be poor country that need to invest more than save   and the us should be take that extra saving        the part that   in excess over investment        and lend out in dollar to poor country where capital be scarce   those country should then be take those dollar and use to buy the capital good from that need to equip worker   would be buy those machine from firm embed in community of engineering practice   thereby profit us company     the us should be run not a trade deficit but a trade surplus   as do the other two lead industrial power   japan and germany   and to the extent that american worker share in the surplus create by healthy community of engineering practice        which always have   to a significant extent        this be good not just for the world economy as a whole but for us worker too   and in order to run that trade surplus   the us should be facilitate manufacture production and export by follow not a    policy but an    policy   a strong dollar be not in america  s interest if mean market price be send the wrong signal   an overly strong dollar tell    manufacturing and other industry that be not useful to society   signal to business that should disrupt these community and outsource more of work   and that do serious damage   so yes   acknowledge us economic policy have be far from perfect   have be far from perfect over the past    year in macroeconomic stance        the reagan and george w  bush tax cut   the belief that less regulation of finance in new york be always good   the belief that the value of the dollar be how keep score   but the      tpp   nafta   and     be not big part of any picture   be not a big part of the    decline in the manufacturing job share   indeed   barely register among the flaw in us international economic policy   by and large   the job that shed as a result of nafta and    be    job that do not really want   because of nafta and    have be able to buy a lot of good stuff much cheap        which mean have have more income to spend on other thing and to pay people to do other   more useful thing than work on      assembly line   skeptical   understand   but leave space to make argument   and will return to this point later       have not do proper job in cushion the income of and provide opportunity to those people and community that have find behind the    in sector flood by import as other country industrialize   especially china     but nafta and    look   to   like thing that have be broadly good for the american economy     and have be even well for america as the world  s dominant superpower   a mexico that be help by the united states make life here more comfortable than a deeply impoverished mexico   china be likely to be    with the us as a superpower by the end of this century   enmesh in economy start now be the good move in a    plan to make that equality one of partnership and alliance rather than competition and cold war   but digress   back to main thread   why do think that what say be the economic policy truth be in fact the truth   here be the story as see   most of the decline in the manufacturing employment share be inevitable the elephant in the room be the collapse over the past three generation of the manufacturing employment share here in america     a manufacturing job make thing in a factory be no longer   in any sense   a typical job for americans   a sector of the economy that provide three out of    nonfarm job at the start of the      and one in four nonfarm job at the start of the      now provide few than one in    nonfarm job

historian   so step back to place current    debate over trade policy in a    century perspective be not enough for   want to go back     time as far   back to the invention of agriculture       from that     perspective   the past    of a century  s relative shift of job out of what call manufacture        a word that in origin be latin for   make thing with hand          be just the late of a number of shift that have take place     first   lose a great many job in hunting and gathering   as agriculture and herding animal come in     second   with the domestication of the horse around      bc   start the process of lose the job that involve drag heavy thing around   horse could pull more and could be largely pay in grass     a bonus   find the grass       third   the arrival of first practical and then theoretical understanding of what be up with nitrogen in the soil and plant growth start the process of lose job in agriculture   each farmer could do more   that process have carry farmer down from    of the labor force to as small a proportion today as   gardener   groundskeeper   and grower of ornamental plant     accord to the bureau of labor statistics     fourth   the

by death by starvation to the united states      in each case   advance technology enable to make vital thing with less human time and energy   demand for those vital thing by those with money to spend do not expand enough to preserve all the job   now   for the past    of a century   have be the turn of    manufacturing job to vanish   to be the beneficiary of such a process be a very good thing   lot more good stuff become available at a cheap price   the       billion     dollar spend on food in        for example   amount to    percent of everything the us make   the         trillion

wife   mother   sister   and daughter back in        to be catch up as a victim of such a process of displacement        to be a farmer who lose job because the economy be get more efficient at produce food        be a bad thing     not just that need to find another job     that need to find another kind of job   may well not be prepare or equip for   and change who be   and that be if can find another job the research suggest   however   that when the economy be do well        a key point        and the plant work in shut down   do   indeed   take a hit   but be not necessarily a staggering hit   income over the next    year turn out to be about    percent low than the income of similarly situate people who be not catch in a mass layoff   do not   as a rule   permanently go from a      manufacturing job to a      mcdonald  s job       in short   those whose job vanish usually find something else to do that do not involve too much downward mobility   whether in income or status   and the benefit of cheap good be   usually   not overly concentrated among the already rich     all americans benefit from inexpensive food   after all   and inexpensive tv and other good      and the process could always be make    for everybody   can   collectively   at least in theory   have everything have before   plus more   figure out how to distribute the fruit of the useful work do in an equitable manner be a problem of societal organization that ought not to be beyond ability to solve   however   a lot of work must be do here by the word   could   in the previous paragraph   and by the concept of   net   benefit   nevertheless   in american politic in        the talk be not about how to better manage a    process of structural economic transformation   in american politic in        the talk be instead truthy talk about the villainy of nafta in        the offense of china join the wto in        and the theoretical disaster of tpp     have trade agreement drive this process of shed manufacturing job in america   and would abrogate nafta   withdraw from the wto   and not ratify the tpp be appropriate and sufficient policy response to the shedding of manufacture job     the clear and obvious answer be   no   germany be widely believe to have a    manufacturing sector   yet have see the same pattern as the us consider a country that have   everyone agree   do everything right as far as nurture manufacturing sector be concern   germany   high national saving lend abroad   which provide foreigner with the deutsch marks   and now euro   to purchase german manufacture   check   eschew a       now euro   policy to make good affordable   check   nurture community of engineering expertise through heavily subsidize apprenticeship and technical training program   check   germany today be the manufacturing export powerhouse of the world        yet here   the share of german employment in manufacturing since          var embeddeltas   chart   document

height   newheight  px       now can say        correctly and truly        that    of that shedding by germany of manufacturing job share be a special case   take place in the first half of the        when the german east be absorb and germany be unify        that unification era see an enormous    structural change   as the inefficient      job of the communist factory of east germany prove uncompetitive on the world market   factory shut   shed worker and release for other   more societally productive use elsewhere in the economy   before the berlin wall come down   east germany  s manufacturing be heavily protect by the tariff barrier throw up by russia  s counterpart to the european union free trade zone   comecon   be further protect by the barrier throw up by east germany  s communist centrally plan allocation economy   even if be cheap to buy manufacture good outside of east germany   could do so only if the planner allow   and would not     when those artificial support for bad business disappear   do east germany  s worker move on to more productive work   yes   most of do   many move to west germany and more robust economy   some   however   do not   and enough wound up on the dole that the sociological aftershock be still be feel today   even    year later   unemployment in the former east germany be   percentage point high than unemployment in the former west germany   but consider this too   an east germany that be only    percent as well off as west germany in      be now    percent as well off as west germany   be very hard to say that the shedding of inefficient   unproductive   and    manufacturing job be a minus for east germans   back to the us   in        low productivity   compare with today   mean that many more worker be need to make each car   each refrigerator   each chair   that keep us manufacture large in term of employment   tariff barrier and high transportation and distribution cost   relative to today   mean that there be very few opportunity for american firm to offshore manufacturing in an efficient way   just as in germany after        the overwhelming bulk of the shedding of the us manufacturing share of employment since the     s be the result of two thing           rise productivity in the face of limited demand   nobody need two dining room table        which now take few worker to create        and even though wife and find that   need   two refrigerator   be weird   this be big         reduction in transportation cost that allow producer elsewhere that use to be unable to serve the us market to do so     reduction in    tariff and    barrier play a very soft second fiddle here     those foreign producer then use the dollar earn to buy other us make product produce in other sector of manufacturing   or in service   this be   compare with the first factor   small   over all   the shedding of    job that result from those two trend be a good thing   but how much of a role in   bad   job shedding do nafta and china join the wto play   and how to distinguish between   good   and   bad   shedding     use germany as a yardstick one possible baseline   give how many people hold up germany as a model for the way have protect manufacturing   be to assume that under the good policy   the us would have match germany   would have shed about    percent of manufacturing job share since        rather than the    percent that do shed   that would have give the us today manufacture employment equal to        percent rather than       percent of nonfarm employment   that represent a gap between reality and one theoretical alternative world of       million manufacture job   call that the excess shrinkage of us manufacturing   be probably an outlier among neoliberal and neoclassical economist in think that most of that shedding        us job shedding that exceed german job shedding        be bad     other believe that be efficient     remember   believe that under proper economic policy   the us should be save more than be invest at home and so help finance the development of the rest of the world   that should eschew the strong dollar   and should do more to nurture and support incredibly valuable community of engineering practice   and pursue such goal would have keep the manufacturing job share high than some neoliberal believe ideal   but such policy would not have keep the manufacturing job share at the    percent of        or the    percent of                      but        percent seem to something that could have be attain in a different world        one without the reagan and w tax cut   without the consequent reagan and w bush budget deficit   one without the overlong    policy and the encouragement of excessive financialization of the economy   and one with proper attention to how manufacture   and engineering   and design   matter   that different world would be a well one       but how much of that gap between american and german performance be cause by nafta   examine the nafta case more closely recall that the      north american free trade agreement     immediately eliminate tariff on    percent of industrial good import into mexico from the us set a    timetable for phase out most tariff        and a    timetable for phase out all tariff        among mexico   the us   and canada   before nafta   mexican tariff average    percent and us tariff average   percent   eliminate a slew of mexican protectionist measure   requirement that the government have to approve certain class of import   local content quota   requirement that mexican firm meet target for export performance most importantly   give mexico guarantee    and    access to the large consumer market in the world   thus eliminate the principal cause of uncertainty that make investor leery of put money into the steel and concrete and machine bolt to the floor that be mexican factory     back in        when republican george h  w  bush be negotiate nafta   ross perot claim that nafta would lead to a   giant sucking sound   as business move huge number of job from the us to mexico   but do nafta drive any rise in the unemployment rate   no   the year after nafta  s implementation be the good as far as unemployment be concern of any since the early        do nafta drive the fall in the manufacturing employment share   no   before nafta be sign   be already    of the way from july      to present state in term of   lose   manufacturing job   be    of the way from january      to present state   even the good policy favorable to nurture a country  s manufacturing sector would not have prevent this process of the shedding of relatively inefficient manufacturing job   the trend precede nafta   and would have continue with or without nafta       even the work of    economist demonstrate this   the most thoughtful and careful think tank that be skeptical of globalization be larry mishel  s economic policy institute   estimate be the most aggressive credible one of deleterious effect of nafta   write for epi   robert scott ascribe the shedding of           manufacture job to the growth of trade with mexico since the passage of nafta   as best as can figure out from the more detailed number provide   estimate imply that manufacturing industry in which be net exporter to mexico gain about           job   and manufacturing industry in which be not importer from mexico lose about           job   that would imply a net loss of           job   but in scott  s view   roughly           of the manufacturing job displace by the pattern of grow trade with mexico be not net reduction in total us job   be   rather   shift in net job from manufacture to other sector   in normal time   the federal reserve respond to overall employment decline by cut interest rate to boost employment in other sector   and thus the job displacement in trade good be roughly offset by job growth elsewhere in the economy   scott suggest that the fed do this job reasonably well at least until        by which point   because of the financial crisis   have lower interest rate as far as could go   after        could offer no useful stimulus   in the end   in scott  s view   there remain             us job displace      between      and             which be   net job loss for the entire economy     in other word   in a world without nafta there would have be           more available position in                  job amount to less than       percent of the us labor force   particular industry be suppose to have be place under dire threat by competition from mexico   most especially auto and auto part   both ross perot and    harley shaiken   a berkeley colleague of mine   put the auto industry at the top of   endanger job   list   mexico   say   have    worker earn low wage in auto assembly plant   and the us simply would not be able to compete   but in the three year after nafta be implement   employment in the american automotive industry grow by        percent   worker hourly earning grow by       percent   and ford   chrysler   and gm invest          billion in new manufacturing plant and equipment in the us        and only     billion in mexico   what seem to have happen be that the north american auto industry react to nafta by rationalize        move those part of that could be effectively perform by relatively    worker to mexico   and thus gain a cost advantage     european and japanese producer   as the trade economist sherman robinson and    write   there be       a dramatic increase in   north american      trade in auto and part         economic   efficiency gain from fine specialization        that   do not appear to be   ricardian     in that be not primarily base on        exploit low wage   but   smithian   in the sense that nafta widen the extent of the market and permit increase return to fine specialization   most fear about the ill effect of nafta on the u  s  auto industry   whether in term of employment   wage   or investment   have be prove wrong      and do note that trade with mexico would have grow and grow in a similar pattern without nafta        merely to a slightly less extent   believe scott be aware of this overarching trend   report be subtitle     trade and job displacement after nafta     rather than something like   trade and job displacement because of nafta     thus the    credible estimate be that nafta produce a shedding of           manufacture job   that represent               of nonfarm employment    of the excess shedding of the manufacturing job share    of the total shedding of the manufacturing job share since        in the context of all the force and disruption affect the us economy and the us distribution of income and wealth over the past    nafta be and be simply not a very big deal   and there be important benefit from nafta   the high real income get from have mexico as a more prosperous trading partner        because dollar buy more good   since those good be cheap        make up one set of benefit   other set of benefit be at least as important   the big of be that need to do what can to make a peaceful world   be part of the us  s job as a superpower to extend a help hand so that mexico can become richer faster   a world in which schoolchildren in the future be teach        truly        that america do all could to close off economic opportunity to other and keep poor and barefoot be unlikely to be a safe world for americans   and make into a bad america as well   but what about china   in the decade from      to        the year china join the wto   the chinese economy sit up   us import from china increase from      billion at      price              percent of the market in the us for manufacture good        to       billion         percent of the market   and then in the    from      to        the chinese economy stand up   us import of chinese good surge from       to       billion at      price        from       percent to       percent of the us manufacture good market   this be   potentially   a big deal than nafta occur in a short time   three time as large an increase in manufacture good import as in mexico in less than half the time   this be the   china shock         the mit economist daron acemoglu and colleague attribute the loss of           american job to the china shock   once again   the    shedding of manufacture job be overwhelmingly a job shift rather than a job loss   the people who lose job in    manufacturing and leave the sector for the most part find job elsewhere        in service   in construction   and so forth   the federal reserve be try to   and largely succeed at   nail the unemployment rate to   percent   estimate of what the american economy could sustain without cause undue inflation   be not until      the federal reserve be tap out   in the sense that be unable or unwilling to adopt policy that expect to return the economy to full employment within a couple of year   so as far as net job loss be concern        as oppose to the redistribution of job        be talk about what have happen since        once again   remember that manufacture good import from china would have surge substantially even have china not join the wto        the development that donald trump claim   enable the great job theft in history     even a china that have not join the wto would have industrialize   and export   therefore   think be not unreasonable to take the true number to be half those of acemoglu et al   halve figure   find that because china join the wto   the us have           more job in manufacturing industry that export to china   and           few manufacturing job in industry where china export to the us   the net loss be               that represent        percentage point of nonfarm employment   that be    of the excess shedding       beyond what germany experience over the same period        of the manufacturing job share   that be    of the total shedding of the manufacturing job share since        once again   not a big deal   the    partnership   rip   tpp the    partnership   be now clear   will never happen   none of the geopolitical gain for which be negotiate will come to pass   nor will any job loss     have tpp go into effect   would not have do nearly as much as nafta or china  s accession to the wto do to reduce the cost and friction that other country face when ship manufacture good to the united states     what tpp would have do be     reassure country in asia that the us be interested in give option other than become part of china  s economic sphere        and   eventually   security sphere give us owner of intellectual property        cough   pharma   cough   hollywood        more legal tool to extract high rent from consumer and punish intellectual property piracy   or   if think   as do   that patent and copyright term be already too long     piracy     on the other side of the pacific   set in stone rule about what right company have when government take step that see as unfairly penalize        rule that be almost surely not the good   and that would want to modify in a decade or so when have more experience do a little bit        less than nafta        to reduce exist trade barrier    be a weak tpp opponent     and   seem to to be good thing     seem to be a bad thing   and   be a good thing for us intellectual property owner but a bad thing from perspective as a rootless global cosmopolite   add up the effect of the    trade agreement the relative decline in employment in manufacturing since world war ii be the big structural change   or evolution   to hit the american economy over the past     politician   with preference for truthiness over the fact   attribute roughly all the    percentage point decline since      in the manufacturing employment share to nafta   to china  s entry into the wto   and to a few other scatter   corporately back unfettered free trade agreement     but        really would like to drive this home        the worrisome part from trade be not the decline in the manufacturing job share from    percent to        percent   but the   excess   decline from        percent to       percent   that worrisome part of the decline of the manufacturing job share be   roughly   only    of the total decline         percentage point   and the amount of decline attributable to the two big bad trade agreement be only    of that          percentage point     in sum   can attribute a mere    of the excess reduction relative to germany in the manufacturing job share to nafta and to china join the wto     when do hurt most to be push out of manufacture   simply to no longer be work in manufacturing   or to not get first job in manufacturing   or to not have the career in manufacture expect   be not by a bad thing   for many   the disappearance of    job be live as be pull out into a well alternative job rather than be push out into a bad one   moreover   even if keep    manufacturing job   under what condition do keep   wage concession under pressure from foreign competition have be a fact of    factory life in america since the coming of the reagan tax cut for the rich        since the era of budget deficit and the elevated dollar     in figure out the economic effect on human being of job shedding   economist steven davis and till von w chter   of stanford and ucla   be the    guy   look at firing as oppose to quit   since one reason may quit be that outside option be good   and mass layoff rather than individual firing   for in mass layoff there be surely no possibility that every worker affect be unusually unproductive     find that if lose job in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate be less than   percent   income over the next    year will be    low than if would avoid get catch up in the mass layoff   that   three year   worth of expect wage that will lose over that period      in short   for the typical american   get catch in economic destruction        creative or not        be a big and bad deal   if not a    one   be right and normal that people should be upset at get catch up on the downside of the industrial evolution and structural transformation of the economy   and americans have every right to demand that the government do something about        not to freeze the relative distribution of job across sector and industry at what be in      or        but to make sure that those who lose out as a result of economic evolution and structural change be compensate reasonably   what form may this compensation take   be the big miss ingredient in help to   sell   and keep sell trade deal   but even think about this be hobble by the fact that the response to such offer of compensation be often   do not want   burial insurance     people often do not want compensation   want thing restore to the way use to be   but   important to note just how crucial the overall macroeconomic context can be when come to job loss   what if be fire in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate be more than   percent   then income over the next    year will fall by more than twice as much as would have in a    economy   such worker will lose fully six year   worth of expect wage over that period   when unemployment be high   find another job quickly be very difficult   and long period in which have not be work be take        sometimes rightly   often wrongly        by employer as a sign that be not a worker want around   thus   keep the unemployment rate reliably below   percent and avoid at all cost episode in which the unemployment rate spike above   percent would be a very effective trade adjustment policy     one reason few people complain about nafta as implementation take hold in the    late        unfortunately for those catch up in the general process of the shrinkage of manufacturing   most of the job loss take place in    recession year   shift    percent of america  s nonfarm labor force out of manufacturing   as have occur since        be not chop liver   have have major effect on american distribution and growth     for    percent of the labor force to lose an average of   say   five year   worth of income each be a huge deal   say that on net the process be a gain do not absolve anyone of be unprepared to figure out what be the appropriate policy to deal with   but    percent of that shift would have occur without the    trade agreement     the effect of nafta and    be soften by a tight us economy and fortunately   the principal effect of nafta and    on american manufacturing take place in the boom year of the late      and the     year of the     the        percent of the american labor force that be push out of manufacture by nafta and    thus lose future income equal to perhaps four year   earning   that   the rough equivalent of       percent of one year  s national income   and those loss be   in simple arithmetic at least   almost surely offset by big gain to those who get to buy great quantity of good import stuff cheap     measure this by the yardstick of the economic cost of what use to think of as a   normal   business cycle recession   which would steal    percent of one year  s american national income        eight time as much        from     and those cost have no upside   unlike trade deal     or measure by the yardstick of the crisis produce by the crash of      and what be now call the longer depression   which look likely to rob the world of total wealth equal to     percent of one year  s american national income   if not more     that   hundred of time more costly than the trade deal    be disturb that the distributional consequence of the large decline in the manufacturing employment share be be hang on two trade agreement   and   as have show   that be utterly unjustified   as hope have make clear   do not want to be read as say that american trade policy have be perfect   or even particularly good     could write an entire piece on what have be wrong with america  s international economic policy   but nafta and    be not   be good trade deal   what have go wrong have be failure to assume global responsibility to be a    nation that help finance the industrialization of the rest of the world   willingness to be a bolthole where foreign kleptocrat and other can store money   reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of community of engineering practice   willingness to use resource provide from abroad to finance consumption by elite rather than investment in america   and desire to charge poor people through the nose for access to what deem     intellectual property     tpp have   or would have have   a role in the last     but how one should organize the global economy to properly nurture and develop community of engineering practice and to move toward an efficient distribution of the work and a less unfair distribution of the wealth of the world economy        that be an argument for a different article   so let break the fourth wall   and say that even though work here as an economist be do   find vitally important that ask all of to try to answer a few political and psychological question      why have so many politician focus on nafta   china join the wto   and the tpp in debate over economic policy     why do leave and right combine so vociferously in opposition to nafta in      and          why be opposition to the tpp so much a litmus test for be a true american        rather than some form of oppressive elite rootless cosmopolite        for both the left and the right today      suspect this be a case of the populist impulse go badly wrong     as a rule   be remarkably hard in america to build any kind of governing or intellectually hegemonic coalition by treat other americans as enemy     as write   donald trump and republican party be probe the limit of this rule and whether the rule still hold     this be a good thing about america   most americans   most of the time   regard almost all of the people who live here as fellow   as    in common enterprise   great contract between the dead   the living   and the unborn   be   in the word of remote ancestor john winthrop aboard the arbella in        engage in the utopian project of build a city upon a hill   and anyone who want to come and join and work for be one of   most americans   most of the time   but        and this be a very important   but          even here in america   can   as definitely can elsewhere   mobilize a great deal of populist energy by identify foreigner as the enemy   do not think this be an impulse that be healthy for any part of this country   do not think this be something any political movement that seek to do anything other than destroy can dare to encourage   and now find far beyond competence   so want to hear from historian   sociologist   political scientist   and cultural study practitioner about why have come to obsess about nafta   about not block china from join the wto   and about tpp

order in which make       very familiar territory   news conference   because use to give on an almost daily basis     trump be exaggerate   during the primary   be a    presence on television because frequently call in to interview show   but generally only hold news conference after primary contest   last hold a news conference on july        see yesterday fiat chrysler   big   big factory go to be build in this country as oppose to another country   ford just announce that stop plan for a    plant in mexico and be go to be move into michigan and expand   very substantially   an exist plant     trump claim credit for these announcement   but that   wrong   sergio marchionne   the fiat chrysler chief executive   say the plan have be in the work for more than a year and have nothing to do with trump   credit instead talk with the united auto workers   with regard to ford   analyst say ford  s decision to expand in michigan rather than in mexico have more to do with the company  s    goal        particularly   plan to invest in electric vehicle        than the trump administration     easy for company to find highly skilled worker to build new product   such as electric car   in the united states than in mexico     when lose    million name and everything else that be hack recently   do not make a big deal out of that   that be something that be extraordinary   that be probably china     actually   the chinese hack of    million account at the office of personnel management be    news   the russian hacking of the presidential election and the opm hack be not directly comparable   the russian campaign   as describe by u  s  intelligence   involve more than just hack   with the aim of disrupting and possibly influence the political process   the chinese hack have a more isolated goal        espionage   china appear to have want the material to engage in possible blackmail   obama administration official say the china case be different because be purely a case of spy        something the united states do as well   u  s  official also say that china respond to u  s  pressure after the hack be discover   and there be sign espionage activity have be reduce   china may have be receptive to u  s  pressure at the time because president xi jinping be about to visit the united states   and do not want the hack to mar the visit     the democratic national committee be totally open to be hack   do a very poor job             and try to hack the republican national committee   and be unable to break through     this be an example of attack one of the victim   the democratic national committee   but fbi director james b  comey say there be evidence that old republican national committee domain be also target but none of the information that may have be obtain be leak   comey say that the russians   get far deep and wide into the   dnc   than the rnc     add that   similar technique be use in both case     but trump  s remark also ignore the broad implication of the unclassified intelligence report release on january          how the russian government use internet troll and rt   russia  s    international news channel   to amplify negative report on clinton and u  s  democracy   the internet troll start to advocate for trump as early as december        well before the wikileaks revelation begin to be release on the eve of the democratic national convention   meanwhile     rt  s coverage of secretary clinton throughout the presidential campaign be consistently negative and focus on leaked email and accuse of corruption   poor physical and mental health   and tie to islamic extremism     the report say     do not mention that these attack line mirror attack make by the trump campaign       look at the thing that be hack   look at what be learn from that hacking   that hillary clinton get the question to the debate and do not report   that   a horrible thing     trump overstate the disclosure about clinton get a debate question   during the democratic primary   a debate be hold in flint   michigan to focus on the water crisis   donna brazile   then an analyst with cnn   send an email to the clinton campaign say that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning be go to ask what clinton as president could do the help the people of flint   there   no indication clinton be tell this information   but in any case   a pretty obvious question for a debate be hold in flint   in answer   clinton commit to remove lead from water system across the country within five year      water   who ask the question   later say clinton  s answer   make vomit in mouth   because that be too long to wait in flint     this administration create isis by leave at the wrong time   the void be create   isis be form     trump greatly simplify a complex situation   the islamic state terrorist group arise in response to the u  s  invasion of iraq in        but begin to fade after the bush administration surge in        the civil war in syria breathe new life into what have become a moribund organization   the conflict in syria create a perfect vacuum in term of governance   and so the civil war become an opportunity for the restoration of the organization   the islamic state then see opportunity to rebound in iraq   one factor be the withdrawal of u  s  troop order by president obama   but there be also rampant mismanagement by the government of iraqi prime minister nouri    which greatly degrade iraq  s military and exacerbate tension between sunnis and shiites         speak at first news conference since

no deal emerge   in        seek to build a condominium complex in russia   that also do not succeed   in        trump sign a    deal with a new york development company to explore a trump tower in moscow   but the effort fizzle   in a      speech   donald trump jr  make clear that the trumps want to do business in russia   but be find difficult     russians make up a pretty disproportionate    of a lot of asset     trump  s son say at a real estate conference in        accord to an account post on the website of eturbonews   a trade publication     see a lot of money pour in from russia     alan garten   general counsel of the trump organization   tell the washington post in may     have no doubt   as a company   know have look at deal in russia   and many of the former russian republics       have a    situation because be president     this be basically correct   the law do not say the president can not have a conflict of interest   but congress   under title    section     of the u  s  code   do exempt the president and vice president from     law on the theory that the presidency have so much power that any possible executive action may pose a potential conflict         speak at first news conference since win the presidential election   donald trump defend decision not to release tax return   say the american people   do not care at all       the washington post        the only one that care about tax return be the reporter             learn very little to a tax return     trump be wrong on both count   a pew research center poll conduct january   to   find that    percent of americans believe trump have a responsibility to release tax return   meanwhile   tax expert say that tax return provide insight about a person  s finance in several key area   first   the tax return reveal a person  s annual income   a person  s net worth be not disclose   but voter would gain an understanding of a person  s cash flow   second   voter would understand the source of a person  s income   such as how much come from certain business   speech   dividend   capital gain and so forth   third   a tax return would disclose how much a person give to charity   mitt romney give almost         million to charity in        while bill and hillary clinton give     million to charity in        know these figure because of information in tax return   trump claim have give       million to charity in the past five year   but a post investigation find not a cent in actual cash        mostly just free round of golf   give away by course for charity auction and raffle   trump  s tax return would clear up exactly how much have really give to charity        indeed   whether have give anything at all   fourth   a tax return would reveal how aggressive trump have be on taxis   there be no     approach to taxis   there be many gray area subject to interpretation   especially regard deduction   trump frequently suggest that know how to game the system   so voter would learn whether take the same approach to taxis   finally   the tax return would disclose what percentage of trump  s income actually go to taxis     have hundred of billion of dollar of loss on a yearly basis        hundred of billion with china on trade and trade imbalance   with japan   with mexico   with just about everybody     a trade deficit simply mean that people in one country be buy more good from another country than people in the second country be buy from the first country   trump  s comment that there   billion of dollar of loss   in trade reflect a fundamental misunderstanding   americans want to buy these product from overseas   either because of quality or price   if trump spark a trade war and tariff be increase on chinese or mexican good   then would raise the cost of those product to americans   perhaps that would reduce the purchase of those good   and thus reduce the trade deficit   but that would not mean the united states would   gain   money that have be lose           donald trump call obamacare a   complete and total disaster   and say will be file a plan to   repeal and replace       the washington post        some state have over a     percent   premium   increase     trump exaggerate here   and appear to misunderstand a fundamental part of the affordable care act       weight average increase range from just       percent in rhode island to as high as    percent in oklahoma   but the most common plan in the marketplace in      experience an average increase of    percent   these plan have be use as the benchmark to calculate government subsidy   the vast majority of marketplace enrollee   about   in      receive government premium subsidy   be protect from a premium increase   and may even see a decrease   if stay with a    plan   accord to the kaiser family foundation     anecdotal example of premium hike or average across insurer can provide a skewed picture of the increase marketplace enrollee will actually face       want to thank united technologies which own carrier   but save close to a thousand job     trump keep count job that be never go to go to mexico in the first place   union official say the number of job save at carrier shrink to       once the official paperwork be submit   meanwhile       job   focus on make fan coil   will go to mexico   as well as     job from a united technologies electronics

million people   and         million be in the labor force   the difference yield the        million figure   but the unemployment rate be only       percent because just       million people actively be look for a job and can not find one   be consider part of the overall labor force   in other word   have to be seek a job to be count in the labor force   who be the    million not in the labor force   the bls have datum for the year        turn out that    percent do not want a job at all   the picture that emerge from a study of the data show that the    million consist mostly of people

unsubstantiated   echo the concern that many other reporter express on the internet     spicer   the fact that buzzfeed and cnn make the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim be a sad and pathetic attempt to get click   the report be not an intelligence report   plain and simple   one issue that the report talk about be the relationship of three individual associate with the campaign   these three individual   paul manafort   michael cohen   and carter page   carter page be an individual who the    do not know and be put on notice month ago by the campaign   paul manafort have adamantly deny any of this involvement and michael cohen   who be say to have visit prague in august and september do not leave or enter the united states during this time   ask to produce passport to confirm whereabouts on the date in question and there be no doubt that be not in prague   in fact   mr  cohen have never be in prague   a new report actually suggest that michael cohen be at     at the university of southern california with son at a baseball game   one report now suggest apparently   another michael cohen   for all the talk lately about fake news   this political witch hunt by some in the medium be base on some of the most flimsy reporting and be frankly shameful and disgraceful   with that   be honor to introduce the next vice president of the united states   mike pence     applause   penny   be nine day away from the inauguration of the   th president of the united states of america     applause   be profoundly honor and humble that will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the united states nine day from today   but be even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make america great again     applause   now   the    s leadership and energy during the campaign be impressive   but as the chairman of the transition effort   can assure the american people that energy and vision during the course of this transition have be even more inspiring   to see the way have bring together man and woman of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet   nineteen of the    cabinet official have be announce   nine committee hearing already schedule   seven more soon to go on the book in the next several day and be a     be a compilation of man and woman with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move nation forward   perhaps that   why there   be such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream medium to delegitimize this election and to demean incoming administration   know   have long be a supporter of a free and independent press and always will be   but with freedom come responsibility   and the irresponsible decision of a few news organization to run with a false and unsubstantiated report   when most news organization resist the temptation to propagate this fake news   can only be attribute to medium bias and attempt to demean the    and incoming administration and the american people be sick and tired of     applause   but today   will get back to real news   to real fact and the real progress incoming president have already make in revive the american economy and assemble a team that will make america great again   and will hear from the    about issue that be of paramount importance to the american people today   so   be honor to introduce to all of   friend and the    of the united states of america   donald trump     applause   trump   thank very much     very familiar territory   news conference

time   straighten out and straighten out for good because veteran have be treat very unfairly   ok   question   yes   john   ph     question     inaudible   so much   trump   thank   question   appreciate   a couple of aspect of the intelligence briefing that receive on friday that be look for further clarification on   trump   sure   question   first of all   do the head of the intelligence agency provide with the    summary of these unsubstantiated allegation   and secondly to that   on the broad picture   do accept opinion that vladimir putin order the hack of the dnc and the attempted hack of the rnc   and if do   how will that color attempt to build a relationship with a leader who have be accuse of commit an act of espionage against the united states   trump   ok   first of all   these reading as know be confidential   classified   so   be not allow to talk about what go on in a meeting   and     but have many witness in that meeting   many of with   and will say   again   think   a disgrace that information would be let out   see the information   read the information outside of that meeting     all fake news     phony stuff   do not happen   and be get by opponent of our   as know   because report and so do many of the other people   be a group of opponent that get together     sick people     and put that crap together   so   will tell that not within the meeting   but outside of the meeting   somebody release   should have never be     number one   should not have even enter paper   but should have never have be release   but read what be release and think   a disgrace   think   an absolute disgrace   as far as hacking   think be russia   but think also get hack by other country and other people   and     can say that know when     when lose    million name and everything else that be hack recently   do not make a big deal out of that   that be something that be extraordinary   that be probably china   have     have much hack go on   and one of the thing be go to do   have some of the great computer mind anywhere in the world that have assemble   see just a sample of two week ago up here where have the six top people in the world     be never in the same room together as a group   and be go to put those mind together and be go to form a defense   trump   and have to say this also   the democratic national committee be totally open to be hack   do a very poor job   could have have hack defense   which have   and will give reince priebus credit   because when reince see what be happen in the world and with this country   go out and go to various firm and order a very   very strong hacking defense   and try to hack the republican national committee and be unable to break through   have to do that for country     very important     crosstalk   question        just to the last part of that question   inaudible   how could all of this potentially color attempt to build a well relationship with president putin   trump   well   know   president putin and russia put out a statement today that this fake news be indeed fake news   say totally never happen   now   somebody would say     oh   of course   go to say that     respect the fact that say that   and     will be honest   think if do have something   would have release   would have be glad to release   think   frankly   have break into the republican national committee   think would have release just like do about hillary and all of the horrible thing that people   like mr  podesta   say about   mean what say about be horrible   if somebody say about   what podesta say about hillary   be the boss   would have fire immediately or that person   because what say about be horrible   but remember this   talk about the hack and hack  s bad and should not be do   but look at the thing that be hack   look at what be learn from that hacking   that hillary clinton get the question to the debate and do not report   that   a horrible thing   that   a horrible thing   can imagine that if donald trump get the question to the debate     would have be the big story in the history of story   and would have say immediately     have to get out of the race     nobody even talk about     a very terrible thing   yeah   question   can ask a question   sir     crosstalk   question   thank   mr      on that intelligence report   the second part of conclusion be that vladimir putin order because aspire to help in the election   do accept that part of the finding   and will undo what president obama do to punish the russians for this or will keep in place   trump   well   if     if putin like donald trump   consider that an asset   not a liability   because have a horrible relationship with russia   russia can help fight isis   which   by the way   be   number one   tricky   mean if look   this administration create isis by leave at the wrong time   the void be create   isis be form   if putin like donald trump   guess what   folk   that   call an asset   not a liability   now   do not know that be go to get along with vladimir putin   hope do   but there   a good chance will not   and if do not   do honestly believe that hillary would be tough on putin than   do anybody in this room really believe that   give a break   ok     crosstalk   question        president obama        crosstalk   question        make clear whether during visit to either moscow or st  petersburg   engage in conduct that now regret and that a reasonable        crosstalk   question   would a reasonable observer say that be potentially vulnerable to blackmail by russia or by intelligence agency   trump   lemme just tell what do   when leave country   be a very    person   would say   be extremely careful   be surround by bodyguard   be surround by people   and always tell     anywhere   but always tell if be leave this country     be very careful   because in hotel room and no matter where go   be go to probably have camera     be not refer just to russia   but would certainly put in that category   and number one     hope be go to be good anyway   but in those room   have camera in the strange place   camera that be so small with modern technology   can not see and will not know   better be careful   or will be watch on nightly television     tell this to people all the time   be in russia year ago   with the miss universe contest   which do very well     moscow   the moscow area do very   very well   and tell many people     be careful   because do not wanna see on television   camera all over the place     and again   not just russia   all over   do anyone really believe that story   be also very much of a germaphobe   by the way   believe     laughter     crosstalk   question        how plan to disentangle from business   but first   have to    on some of these russian remark   base on comment here today   do believe the hacking be justified   do russia have any leverage over   financial or otherwise   and if not   will release tax return to prove   trump   so tweet out that have no dealing with russia   have no deal that could happen in russia   because have stay away   and have no loan with russia   as a real estate developer   have very   very little debt   have asset that be     and now people have find out how big the company be   have very little debt     have very low debt   but have no loan with russia at all   and think that be important to put out   certify that   so have no deal   have no loan and have no dealing   could make deal in russia very easily if want to   just do not want to because think that would be a conflict   so have no loan   no dealing   and no current pende deal   now   have to say one other thing   over the weekend   be offer     billion to do a deal in dubai with a very   very   very amazing man   a great   great developer from the middle east   hussein damack   a friend of mine   great guy   and be offer     billion to do a deal in dubai     a number of deal and turn down   do not have to turn down   because as know   have a    situation because be president   which be     do not know about that until about three month ago   but   a nice thing to have   but do not want to take advantage of something   have something that other do not have   vice president pence also have   do not think will need   have a feeling   not go to need   but have a no conflict of interest provision as president   be many   many year old   this be for president   because do not want president get     understand do not want president get tangle up in minutia   want a president to run the country   so could actually run business   could actually run business and run government at the same time   do not like the way that look   but would be able to do that if want to   would be the only one to be able to do that   can not do that in any other capacity   but as president   could run the trump organization   great   great company   and could run the company     the country   would do a very good job   but do not want to do that   now   all of these paper that see here     yes   go ahead   question     inaudible   do believe the hacking be justify   and will release tax return to prove what be say about no deal in russia   trump   be not release the tax return because as know   be under audit     crosstalk   question        since the       s have have a require audit from the irs   the last place to release   but as president sir      trump   know   the only one that care about tax return be the reporter   ok   be the only who ask   question   do not think the american public be concerned about   trump   no do not think so   win   when become president   no   do not think care at all   do not think care at all     applause   trump   think care     think care   first of all   learn very little to a tax return   what should go down to federal election and take a look at the number   and actually   people have learn a lot about company and now realize   company be much big   much more powerful than ever think   be in many   many country   and be very proud of   and what be go to be do be two son   who be right here   don and eric   be go to be run the company   be go to be run in a very professional manner   be not go to discuss with   again   do not have to do this   be not go to discuss with   and with that   be go to bring up sheri dillon   and   go to go     these paper be just some of the many document that have sign turn over complete and total control to son     crosstalk   dillon   good morning     honor and privilege to be here today at    trump  s request     ask   as just hear   to speak about the conflict of interest and the step   take   as know   the business empire build by    trump over the year be massive   not dissimilar to the fortune of nelson rockefeller when become vice president   but at that time   no one be so concerned      trump want the american public to rest assured that all of effort be direct to pursue the people  s business and not own   to that end   as explain a few moment ago   direct and colleague at the law firm morgan lewis and bockius to design a structure for business empire that will completely isolate from the management of the company   further instruct that build in protection that will assure the american people the decision make and the action that take as president be for benefit and not to support financial interest   dillon   as say     voluntarily take this on   the conflict of interest law simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and be not require to separate from financial asset   the primary conflict of interest statute and some have question   be section    usc     and   simply inapplicable by term   and this be not just interpretation     congress who have make this clear in      when amend section    usc     to state that   except as otherwise provide   the term office and employee in section     shall not include the president   even so      trump want there to be no doubt in the mind of the american public that be completely isolate from business interest   instruct to take all step realistically possible to make clear that be not exploit the office of the presidency for personal benefit   also seek the guidance of individual who be familiar with and have work extensively in the field of government ethic and constitutional law   critical to the morgan lewis team be fred fielding   stand here to side and with today and many of have know   have serve several president over the year include serve as counsel to presidents ronald reagan and george w  bush as well as serve on president george h  w  bush  s commission on federal ethics law reform and also hold the position of vice chair of the ethics resource center   mr  fielding have be extensively involve with and approve this plan     here today to support the plan and will continue to provide guidance as the plan be implement and as eric   don   along with other   take over management of the trump organization   be go to detail some of the extraordinary step now that the    be take   first      trump  s investment and business asset commonly know as the     as the trump organization   comprise hundred of entity which   again   if all go and take a look at financial disclosure statement   the page and page and page of entity have all be or will be convey to a trust prior to january   th   here be just some of the paperwork that   take care of those action   second   through the trust agreement   have relinquish leadership and management of the trump organization to son don and eric and a longtime trump executive   allen weisselberg   together   don   eric and allen will have the authority to manage the trump organization and will make decision for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by    trump   further   at the    s direction   the trust agreement provide     that to ensure the trump organization continue to operate in accordance with the high and legal ethic standard   an ethic adviser will be appoint to the management team   the write approval of the ethic adviser will be require for new deal   action   and transaction that could potentially raise ethic or conflict of interest concern      trump as well as don   eric and allen be commit to ensure that the activity of the trump organization be beyond reproach and can not be perceive to be exploitive of the office of the presidency      trump will resign from all officer and other position hold with the trump organization entity   further   in addition   daughter ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the trump organization   as and jared move family to d  c  ivanka will focus on settle child into new home and new school   the    have also already dispose of all of investment in publicly trade or easily liquidate investment   as a result   the trust will have two type of asset   first   will hold liquid asset   cash   cash equivalent and treasury and perhaps some position in a government approve diversified portfolio   one that be consistent with the regulation from the office of government ethics   second   the trust be go to hold preexisting illiquid   but very valuable business asset   the one that everyone here be familiar with   trump own   operate and brand golf club   commercial rental property   resort   hotel   right to royalty from preexisting license of    production and good   thing like trump tower       all of other business asset      wall street will all be in the trust   through instruction in the trust agreement      trust       trump first order that all pende deal be terminate   this impact more than    deal   many of which be set to close by the end of        as can well imagine   that cause an immediate financial loss of million of dollar   not just for    trump   but also for don   ivanka and eric   dillon   the trust agreement as direct by president trump impose severe restriction on new deal   no new foreign deal will be make whatsoever during the duration of president trump  s presidency   new domestic deal will be allow   but will go through a vigorous vetting process   the    will have no role in decide whether the trump organization engage in any new deal and will only know of a deal if read in the paper or see on tv   because any new deal could     and emphasize could     be perceive as cause a conflict or as exploit the office of the presidency   new deal must be vet with the ethic adviser   whose role will be to analyze any potential transaction for conflict and ethic issue   the ethic adviser will be a recognize expert in the field of government expert   again   role will be to scrutinize the new deal and the action   and any new deal must receive write approval   to further reinforce the wall that be build between    trump and the trump organization      trump have order   through trust agreement   to sharply limit information right   report will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole   there will be no separate business by business accounting   another step that    trump have take be create a new position at the trump organization   the position of chief compliance counsel   whose responsibility will be to ensure that the trump business   again   be operate at the high level of integrity and not take any action that could be perceive as exploit the office of the presidency   have also direct that no communication of the trump organization   include social medium account   will reference or be tie to    trump  s role as president of the united states or the office of the presidency   in sum   all of these action     complete relinquishment of management   no foreign deal   ethic adviser approval of deal   sharply limited information right     will sever    trump  s presidency from the trump organization   some have ask question   why not divest   why not just sell everything   form of blind trust   and would like to turn to address some of those question now   sell   first and foremost   would not eliminate possibility of conflict of interest   in fact   would exacerbate   the trump brand be key to the value of the trump organization  s asset   if    trump sell brand   would be entitle to royalty for the use of   and this would result in the trust retain an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that do not exploit the office of the presidency   further   whatever price be pay would be subject to criticism and scrutiny   be too high   be there pay for play   be too much pay to curry favor with the     and sell asset without the right to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the asset and create a fire sale      trump should not be expect to destroy the company build   this plan offer a suitable alternative to address the concern of the american people   and sell the entire trump organization be not even feasible   some people have suggest that the    sell the business to adult child   this would require massive    debt source with multiple lender   whose motive and willingness to participate would be question and undoubtedly investigate   and if the    be to finance the sale   would retain the financial interest in the asset that own now   some people have suggest that the trump     that    trump could bundle the asset and turn the trump organization into a public company   anyone who have ever go through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process know that be a     be not realistic and would be inappropriate for the trump organization   some people have suggest a blind trust   but can not have a totally blind trust with operating business   president trump can not unknow own trump tower and the press will make sure that any new development at the trump organization be well publicize   dillon   further   would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the trump organization   the approach that be take allow don and eric to preserve this great company and iconic asset   and this approach be good from a conflict and ethic perspective   create a complete separation from    trump     separate and prevent from participate in the business and pose strict limit on what the trustee can do and require the assent of any ethic adviser to a new deal   be go to turn to one last topic today that have be of interest lately call emolument   that   a word think have all become familiar with and perhaps have not hear before   and be go to describe some other action that    trump be take to avoid even the appearance of a conflict   emolument come from the constitution   the constitution say   official may not accept gift   title of nobility   or emolument from foreign government with respect to office   and that no benefit should be derive by hold in office     the    emoluments clause have never be interpret   however   to apply to fair value exchange that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder   no one would have think when the constitution be write that pay hotel bill be an emolument   instead   would have be think of as a     exchange   not a gift   not a title   and not an emolument   but since    trump have be elect   some people want to define emolument to cover routine business transaction like pay for hotel room   suggest that the constitution prohibit the business from even arm     transaction that the    have absolutely nothing to do with and be not even aware of   these people be wrong   this be not what the constitution say   pay for a hotel room be not a gift or a present and have nothing to do with an office     not an emolument   the

mr  trump     inaudible   from america news   what be response to critic that say not only   but also cabinet be fill with conflict of interest   and do plan to set an example in the future to make sure that     cabinet and everyone throughout administration        crosstalk   trump       really think that when watch what   go on with what   happen in     be just watch   as an example   rex tillerson   think   brilliant what   do and what   say   watch yesterday   as know   great senator   who be go to be a great attorney general   and be brilliant   and what people do not know be that be a great prosecutor and attorney general in alabama   and be brilliant yesterday   so   really think that be     think have one of the great cabinets ever put together   and have be hear that from so many people   people be so happy   know   in the case of rex   run incredibly exxon mobil   when there be a find   would get   when need something   would be there   a friend of who   very   very substantial in the oil business   harold hamm     big supporter     say there   nobody in the business like rex tillerson   and that   what want   that   what want to bring to government   want to bring the great people into government   because be way behind   do not make good deal any more   say all the time in speech   do not make good deal anymore   make bad deal   trade deal be a disaster   trump   have hundred of billion of dollar of loss on a yearly basis     hundred of billion with china on trade and trade imbalance   with japan   with mexico   with just about everybody   do not make good deal anymore   so need people that be smart   need people that be successful and get successful because generally speak   be smart   and that   what would put   be very proud of the cabinet   think be do very well     very interesting how   go   but       think be do very   very well     crosstalk   question        a quick    on     on russia   sir   question   thank   mr      want to ask a few question on obamacare   trump   yeah   question   can be specific on what guidance be give congressional republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace   whether need to be simultaneous or        crosstalk   trump   finally   obamacare   think be never go to be ask   question       though if have outline a plan for what want the replace package to look like   would guarantee coverage for those who have get health insurance through the current obamacare law   trump   be go to be very   very proud   as not only the medium and reporter   be go to be very proud of what put forth have to do with health care   obamacare be a complete and total disaster   can say what want   can guide anyway wanna guide   in some case   guide incorrectly   in most case   realize what   happen     implode as sit   some state have over a hundred percent increase and      and say this two year ago        be go to be the bad year     go to be catastrophic   frankly   could sit back and be a thought from a political standpoint   but would not be fair to the people   could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and could be a chuck schumer and sit back and criticize and people would come   would come   beg to please   have to do something about obamacare   do not wanna own   do not wanna own politically   own right now   so the easy thing would be to let implode in      and believe   would get pretty much whatever want   but would take a long time   be go to be submit   as soon as secretary  s approve   almost simultaneously   shortly thereafter   a plan   will be repeal and replace   will be essentially   simultaneously   will be various segment   understand   but will most likely be on the same day or the same week   but probably   the same day   could be the same hour   so be go to do repeal and replace   very complicated stuff   and be go to get a health bill pass   be go to get health care take care of in this country   have deductible that be so high   that after people go break pay premium which be go through the roof   the health care can not even be use by because deductible bill be so high   obamacare be the democrats problem   be go to take the problem off the shelf for   be do a tremendous service by do   could sit back and let hang with   be do the democrats a great service   so as soon as secretary be approve and get into the office   will be file a plan   and be actually   pretty accurately report today   the new york times   and the plan will be repeal and replace obamacare   be go to have a health care that be far less expensive and far well   ok     crosstalk   question      can just ask     sir   sir      question      trump        crosstalk   question   mr  president     which one   trump   be go right here     crosstalk   question      trump   jon steinberg   ph   from cheddar   when look at all the meeting that have have with carrier   softbank and alibaba   do conceive of make this a program   maybe sit inside of commerce   and then    question to that   be how soon will see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cut   trump   well   if can save job   for instance be do individual company and people say well   that   only one company   like do a good job with carrier   and wanna thank united technologies which own carrier   but save close to a thousand job   and be go and mike pence and staff really help   a lot   but those be     that be a tough one because announce a year and a half before that be leave so   always tough when be build a plan   just a little tough than before start or before make an announcement   trump   so wanna thank united technologies   but have be meet with a lot of company   but what really be happen   be the word be now out   that when want to move plant to mexico or some other place   and want to fire all of worker from michigan and ohio and all these place that win   for good reason     not go to happen that way anymore   want to move plant and think   as an example   be go to build that plant in mexico and be go to make air conditioner or car or whatever be make   and be go to sell through what will be a very   very strong border     not a weak border like be     do not even have a border     an open sieve   but be go to sell through a very strong border     not go to happen   be go to pay a very large border tax   so if want to move to another country and if want to fire all of great american worker that get there in the first place   can move from michigan to tennessee and to north carolina and south carolina   can move from south carolina back to michigan   can do anywhere     have get a lot of state at play   a lot of competition   so   not like   oh   gee   be take the competition away   have get a lot of place can move   and do not care   as along as   within the united states   the border of the united states   there will be a major border tax on these company that be leave and get away with murder   and if politician have what take   would have do this year ago   and would have million more worker right now in the united states that be        million really want a job and can not get   know that story   the real number     that   the real number   so   that   the way be   ok   go ahead   question      have a question about the supreme court and border security   but also want to ask about something say on twitter this morning   be live in nazi germany   what be drive at there   do have a problem with the intelligence community   and on the supreme court   what   timeline   say a while ago be down to four   have conduct those interview yet   what   timeline for nominate   and on the border fence   now appear clear u  s  taxpayer will have to pay for up front   what be plan to      trump   that   not clear at all   ok     crosstalk   question        to get mexico to pay for   trump   have get   do have any more     laughter   on the fence       not a fence     a wall   just misreporte   be go to build a wall   could wait about a      until finish negotiation with mexico   which will start immediately after get to office   but do not want to wait   mike pence be lead an effort to get final approval through various agency and through congress for the wall to begin   do not feel like wait a year or a       be go to start build   mexico in some form   and there be many different form   will reimburse and will reimburse for the cost of the wall   that will happen   whether   a tax or whether   a payment     probably less likely that   a payment   but will happen   so   remember this   ok   would say be go to build a wall and people would go crazy   would then say   who be go to pay for the wall   and people would all scream out                         people   because nobody have ever have crowd like trump have have   know that   do not like to report that   but that   ok   ok   now agree   finally   agree   but say who be go to pay for the wall   and will scream out     mexico     now   report go out last week     oh   mexico be not go to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement   what   the difference   want to get the wall start   do not want to wait a      until make deal with mexico   and probably will have a deal sooner than that   and by the way   mexico have be so nice   so nice   respect the government of mexico   respect the people of mexico   love the people of mexico   have many people from mexico work for   be phenomenal people   the government of mexico be terrific   do not blame for what   happen   do not blame for take advantage of the united states   wish politician be so smart   mexico have take advantage of the united states   do not blame the representative and various president   et cetera   of mexico   what say be should not have allow that to happen     not go to happen anymore   so   in order to get the wall start   mexico will pay for the wall   but will be reimburse   ok   supreme court judge   so   as know   have a list of      have go through   have meet with numerous candidate   be outstanding in every case   be largely recommend and highly recommend by federalist society   jim demint be also very much involved   and group   which be fantastic   and   a fantastic guy   trump   so between leo and jim demint and some senator and some congresspeople   have a great group of people   will be make the decision on who will put up for justice of the united states supreme court   a replacement for the great   great justice scalia   that will be probably within two week of the   th   so within about two week   probably the second week   consider the first day because will also be do some     some pretty good signing and think what will do be will wait until monday   that will be really first

week   and be all invite   but on the supreme court   will be make that decision   and will be a decision which very strongly believe in   think   one of the reason get elect   think the people of this country do not want to see what be happen with the supreme court   so think be a very   very big decision as to why be elect   question   the tweet that have this morning about be live in nazi germany   what be drive at there   what be try to tell the american public   trump   think be disgraceful     disgraceful that the intelligence agency allow any information that turn out to be so false and fake out   think   a disgrace   and say that     and say that   and that   something that nazi germany would have do and do do   think   a disgrace that information that be false and fake

conclusion that any of stand up   that any of be true   will consider position      trump   there   nothing could come back with   question   can      trump   go ahead   question     inaudible   publish fake news and all the problem that have see throughout the medium over the course of the election   what reform do recommend for this industry here   trump   well   do not recommend reform

some of the medium outlet that deal with be fake news more so than anybody   could name   but will not bother   but have a few sit right in front of   be very   very dishonest people   but think   just something be go to have to live with   trump   guess the advantage have be that can speak back   when happen to somebody that do not have this     do not have that kind of a megaphone   can not speak back     a very sad thing   have see people destroy   have see people absolutely destroy   and think   very unfair   so   all can ask for be honest reporter   yes     crosstalk   question   just

be actually weaken national security by wage this war of word against that community   trump   intelligence agency be vital and very   very important   be go to be put in   as know   mr  pompeo and other   know the senator dan coats   be go to be put in some outstanding people   within    day   be go to be come back to with a major report on hack   want to cover this situation   also want   however   to cover   maybe most importantly     because be hack by everybody     know   the united states   government out of a list of    in term of industry be the bad     number      in term of protection   if look at the retail industry   if look at the banking industry   various industry   out of    industry     put this in the category of an industry     the united states be last in term of protect   let say   hack defense   like have a great hacking defense at the republican national committee   that   why be not hack   by the way   be tell that be try to hack   but be not able to hack   and think get some credit because tell reince   and reince do a phenomenal job   but say want strong hack defense   the democratic national committee do not do that   maybe that   why the country run so badly that way   but will tell     wait     wait     wait   let finish   within    day   will be come up with a major report on hack defense   how do stop this new phenomenon     fairly new phenomenon because the united states be hack by everybody   that include russia and china and everybody     everybody   ok     crosstalk   trump   go ahead     go ahead   question   mr     say   just now   that believe russia indeed be responsible for the hacking of the dnc and jon podesta  s    et cetera   trump   all right   but know what   could have be other also   question   but why do spend week undermine u  s  intelligence community before simply get the fact and then make a public statement   trump   well   think   pretty sad when intelligence report get leak out to the press   think   pretty sad   first of all     illegal   know   these be     these be classify and certify meeting and report   will tell what do happen   have many meeting with intelligence   and every time meet   people be read about   somebody   leak out   so   there       maybe   office   maybe in office because have a lot of people   a lot of great people   maybe     and what do be say will not tell anybody   be go to have a meeting and will not tell anybody about meeting with intelligence   and what happen be have meeting   nobody know   not even rhona   executive assistant for year   do not know     do not tell   nobody know   the meeting be have   the meeting be over   leave   and immediately the word get out that have a meeting   so   do not want that     do not want that     very unfair to the country     very unfair to country   what   happen   that report should have never     first of all   should not have be print because   not worth the paper   write on   and thank the new york times for say that   thank a lot of different people for say that   but   will tell   that should never   ever happen   ok     crosstalk   question   thank   mr     can stand here today   once and for all and say that no one connect to or campaign have any contact with russia lead up to or during the presidential campaign   and if do indeed believe that russia be behind the hacking   what be message to vladimir putin right now   trump   should not be do   will not be do   russia will have much great respect for country when be lead than when other people have lead   will see that   russia will respect country more   should not have do   do not believe that will be do more now   have to work something out   but   not just russia   take a look at what   happen   do not report the same way      million account be hack in this country by china   and that   because have no defense   that   because be run by people that do not know what be do   trump   russia will have far great respect for country when be lead and believe and hope     maybe will not happen     possible   but will not be give   ph   a little reset button like hillary   here   press this piece of plastic   a guy look at like what be do   there   no reset button   be either go to get along or be not   hope get along   but if do not   that   possible too   but russia and other country     and other country   include china   which have take total advantage of economically   totally advantage of in the south china sea by build massive fortress   total   russia   china   japan   mexico   all country will respect far more   far more than do under past administration   want to thank everybody   so this be all     just so understand   these paper     because be not sure that be explain properly   but these paper be all just a piece of the many   many company that be be put into trust to be run by two son that hope at the end of eight year   will come back and say   oh   do a good job   otherwise   if do a bad job   will say     be fire        everybody

",          at presser today   donald trump confirm the very bad fear of ethic expert   announce a new arrangement for business holding that be design to garner nice headline but be unlikely to do much to reduce the possibility of conflict of interest and   possibly   full blow corruption   trump do nothing to address the central ethical problem face   will not divest of holding   only transfer control of to two son   the post sum up the arrangement   trump will shift asset into a trust manage by son and give up management of private company           the announcement include a pledge from a trump lawyer that the company would make   no new foreign deal whatsoever   during trump  s presidency   and that any new domestic deal would undergo vigorous review   include approval by an independent ethic adviser   but trump  s commitment will not resolve what federal official and ethic advisor say be most key conflict   continue ownership of business   the trump organization   that will ensure trump will still have a vested financial interest in a global private company when take office next week   sheri dillon   a tax advisor at morgan lewis   say trump have seek to completely isolate from the business and   will only know of a deal if see in the paper or on tv     but will not sell the business or stake   add       trump should not be expect to destroy the company build          donald trump have own   birther   crisis      take two key provision here   the idea for a new ethic adviser that would sign off on new deal   and the pledge to   isolate   from the business to the degree that will not know about any new deal unless read about in the medium   the problem be obvious   even if trump take these step   and even if do transfer holding into a trust manage by son   still know what business holding be   regardless of whether know about any   new   deal or whether any such new deal pass muster with ethic adviser   that mean that much of the potential for conflict remain in place   trump will be make regulatory decision impact business   such as bank   that be entangle with own   will be set american policy in country where retain holding   trump  s business could even directly benefit from trump policy   only full divestment would have suffice to ward off potential conflict in these area     the trump plan fall short in every respect     norm eisen   the former ethic watchdog in the obama administration   email     trump do not make a clean break with business ownership interest as predecessor for four decade have do       trump  s    course will precipitate scandal and corruption     eisen add   make thing even worse   nor do trump make any vow of increase transparency into holding   trump once again rebuff call to release tax return   which may have help create such transparency   and do not announce any additional step to provide in any other way   this mean another core problem remain   because be not privy to the full scope and range of those holding   simply can not know whether such conflict        or corruption        be take place in any give situation        trump  s    to conflict of interest and emolument problem        as long as    trump maintain ownership of business   will know when tax or regulatory or policy change benefit bottom line     noah bookbinder   the executive director of citizens for responsibility and ethics   tell today     will also know when policy decision will benefit by benefit other company whose interest be tie up with   or benefit foreign country whose interest affect business       even worse   because do not know the scope of interest   will not even know when there   such a situation where such a conflict be possible or happen     bookbinder add   appear to be enter into truly uncharted territory   the vast extent of trump  s global holding   combine with opacity   create both a level of potential for conflict   and an inability for to track those conflict   that render all effort to predict the consequence utterly hopeless   be hard to say what will happen now   the role of the press in try to keep track of those conflict will be crucial   but on that front   too   what see at today  s presser be cause for alarm   trump tear into cnn as   fake news   for publish a careful if provocative and    story on unverified claim that russian intelligence gather compromise information on   trump ferociously attack buzzfeed for publish a dossier of those claim   pointedly note that buzzfeed would   suffer the consequence     that would be worrisome enough on own   but combine with trump  s unprecedented dishonesty and refusal to revise claim when be widely call out as false   and all start to smack of an effort to stamp out the very possibility of share agreement on the legitimate institutional role of the news medium or even on reality     easy to imagine that   if and when a news organization uncover potential conflict   trump will simply deny the reality of what   be uncover     fake news     and begin threaten   consequence   towards that organization   one thing that remain clear   congressional republicans be not go to step up and try to mitigate this situation   republicans be not go to take any of the step could be take to try to prod trump into show more transparency about holding   which would make conflict and corruption less likely     hard to see that change   unless   perhaps   intensify medium scrutiny shake loose enough scandalous story to make the lack of congressional action untenable   that will also require public pressure        of the sort that force republicans to reverse recently on plan to gut an independent ethic oversight office   but probably a lot more   right now   serious pessimism appear to be a reasonable default setting   could be entirely wrong about this        maybe trump really will surprise   if not   institution be go to be test in unforeseen way   and will be on        through vigilance   organizing

",        absolute zero   be not just cold          still   be the point at which the motion of the atom that make up an object stop completely   when the object have no energy leave to give   the rule of physics say   impossible to cool an object to absolute zero   to remove all thermal energy until atom come to a standstill   but researcher at the national institute of standards and technology be get really close   in a paper publish wednesday in the journal nature   describe use a laser to make a microscopic aluminum drum cold than anything like have be cool before   in do so   defy the quantum limit for supercoole mechanical object   the new technique will allow physicist to make stuff cold than previously think possible   say lead author john teufel   a physicist at the nist facility in boulder   open the door to build instrument of unprecedented sensitivity   and to understand quantum mechanic        one of physics  s most mysterious branch        better than ever before   give chill   do not     sorry   guy   have to     recall that everything in the universe be in motion   not just on broad scale        planet orbit sun   galaxy turn        but on the small one   even the most seemingly impassive object buzz with internal activity   the atom that make up a piece of aluminum   like the one in teufel  s experiment   be always bump into and bounce off one another   jump   spin   spread out and press together   this be what physicist be refer to when talk about temperature   not some abstract idea of an object  s   warmth   but a measure of the thermal motion of atom        why do not bird get lose   may have master quantum mechanic        physicist be interested in supercoole for two reason   first   if can remove the thermal energy from an object   become much more sensitive to outside perturbation   researcher like those at ligo        the lab that detect gravitational wave last year        want instrument to be as cool as possible so can be sure that any tiny fluctuation be a result of vast cosmic force   and not just bore thermal motion   in addition   eliminate the distraction of an object  s thermal motion allow scientist to finally see the motion that result from quantum energy   which be much more interesting   will give insight into the force that dictate how the universe function at atomic and subatomic scale   researcher have manage to cool individual atom and even a quantum gas until near or sink below absolute zero   but supercoole large   solid object        which will be essential to build well instrument and understand quantum mechanic at a macroscopic level        have prove harder        scientist just get one of the good measure yet of a fundamental of physics      the good technique for remove thermal energy from object be call sideband cooling   use an array of laser to slow the atom down   this may seem counterintuitive        be use to light warm thing up   like the sun        but in sideband cooling   the carefully calibrate angle and frequency of the light allow photon to snatch energy from the atom as interact     if shine exactly the right light in the right way can make sure the light be always push against the motion of the atom     teufel say     for an    explanation of the process   see this great video from pbs     scientist have be cool atom with laser for several decade   but there be a limit to how cold could get   quantum mechanic tell that   because of the way light work   instead of flow in a continuous stream   travel in discrete packet   call quanta   each packet   give a little kick   as arrive   teufel say   mean a little bit of heat get add even as remove energy over all     like try to keep a leaf suspend in the air with several sputtering hose        every time the stream falter   the leaf drift       the microscopic drum that john teufel and colleague use in cool experiment         use sideband cooling   researcher at nist have previously cool quantum drum        a microscopic aluminum membrane that vibrate like a drumhead        to low energy   ground state     at that point   the drum  s thermal motion be    the amount of quantum motion   some think this represent the   quantum limit          the cold temperature that could be achieve accord to the law of quantum mechanic     the limit of how cold can make thing by shine light on be

hillary clinton  s email practice and the bureau  s controversial decision shortly before the election to announce the probe have resume   the inspector general announce thursday   the probe will be wide range        encompass the fbi  s various public statement on the matter   whether deputy director should have be recuse and whether fbi or other justice department employee leak nonpublic information   accord to a news release from inspector general michael e  horowitz   the announcement of the probe suggest that multiple aspect of comey  s conduct will be examine   among       the probe will look at allegation that comey  s july press conference be in violation of fbi procedure   as will recall   at that presser   comey announce not just that the fbi have decide not to recommend criminal charge   but also that clinton and colleague have be   extremely careless in handling of very sensitive   highly classified information     republican seize on that to argue that the fbi have show that clinton be unfit for the presidency   while simultaneously argue that clinton have benefit from an fbi cover up       the probe will look at comey  s decision to notify congress only day before the election that new email that be potentially relevant to the previous investigation have be discover   not only do trump and republicans hype the live hell out of these revelation as proof that new evidence of criminality have be discover   many news organization also hype this information in an indefensible way       the investigation will also look at the question of whether a senior justice official leak information improperly to the clinton campaign about a pende congressional hearing into email     there   be some twitter speculation to the effect that once the trump administration take over   can close this probe down   but the inspector general be a   statutorily create independent entity     and former justice department official tell today that see this outcome as highly unlikely     an inspector general have very broad power to decide what to investigate     jamie gorelick   a washington litigator and former deputy attorney general   tell today     that authority be not subject to the direction of an attorney general   when be deputy attorney general   never feel have the right to direct an inspector general not to investigation something       could fire the inspector general   but that would be a saturday night massacre situation     add matthew miller   a former justice department spokesman who criticize comey  s conduct at the time     if so   would see resignation at the justice department   that would be a huge breakdown in the rule of law     both the july press conference and the late october decision to notify congress that new email have be find come under scald criticism   some argue that the press conference break fbi rule that preclude investigator from publicly criticize someone against whom the agency have decide not to recommend charge   and when comey notify congress of the new email   current and former justice official see this as a break with justice department policy design to prevent official from interfere in election   a finding by the inspector general that comey do act improperly in one or both of these case would go some way towards vindicate this criticism     if this investigation go the way suspect will   will codify what many people believe   which be that there be a stain on the fbi     miller   the former justice spokesman   add     if the ig issue an official finding   will confirm what bipartisan former prosecutor say   hopefully will prevent future fbi director and people at the justice department from break the rule during future election     comey  s conduct        and the question of whether influence the election        matter   there be some polling evidence that suggest that the last minute intervention by comey may have cost clinton the election   while be so close that any number of individual thing may have make the difference   nate silver have suggest comey have a   large   measurable impact   on the race   trump and republicans have repeatedly scoff at suggestion that comey  s impact matter   which suggest that worry that such claim about the comey intervention undercut perception of popular support for trump   note that trump and supporter like to say that win by a landslide   which be complete nonsense   but in a way   the question of whether comey  s conduct swing the election be not just unanswerable   but be also irrelevant to the question of whether conduct be justify   a serious investigation into that conduct        whatever the impact on perception of the meaning of the election  s outcome        be desirable on own   at a time when public confidence in the integrity of democracy be be strain by all sort of development   this could bring about some sorely need accountability   and make less likely that such a thing happen again

that action be   necessary to prevent the significant impairment to the national interest of the united states     and there be congressional notification requirement as well       can not think of

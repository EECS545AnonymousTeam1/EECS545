the dispute subsidy could conceivably cause the health care program to implode   leave million of people without access to health insurance before republicans have prepare a replacement   that could

appeals for the district of columbia circuit   be not yet ready to divulge strategy     give that this pende litigation involve the obama administration and congress   would be inappropriate to

such as deductible and    for eligible consumer could race to drop coverage since would be lose money   over all   the loss of the subsidy could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that lead other insurer to seek a quick exit as well   anticipate that the trump administration may not be incline to mount a vigorous fight against the house republicans give the    s dim view of the health care law   a team of lawyer this month seek to intervene in the case on behalf of two participant in the health care program   in request   the lawyer predict that a deal between

constitution   in the suit   which be initially champion by john a  boehner   the house speaker at the time   and later in house committee report   republicans assert that the administration   desperate for the funding   have require the treasury department to provide despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending be proper   the white house say that the spending be a permanent part of the law pass in        and that no annual appropriation be require        even though the administration initially seek one   just as important to house republicans   judge collyer find that congress have the standing to sue the white house on this issue        a ruling that many legal expert say be flaw        and want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch   but on spend power and standing   the trump administration may come under pressure from advocate of presidential authority to fight the house no matter share view on health care   since those precedent could have broad repercussion   be a complicated set of dynamic illustrate how a quick legal victory for the house in the trump era may come with cost that republicans never anticipate when take on the obama white house

day this summer as work on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim  s aunt about why the killer have not be catch     and people just do not understand that     often be detective who most feel the effect of people turn on the police   witness shout away from door just so neighbor know refuse to talk   of the     people who be shoot and wound in the bronx through early september   more

of the     strategy   in        the   th precinct have the    stop in the city   the    stop in which officer use force and the most frisk   of          stop that year            be of people who have do nothing criminal   the precinct be also one of the    area that the department flood with new officer   at roll call   be pressure to generate number   write ticket and make arrest   have no choice but to give a summon to a young man play in a park after dark   even if the officer have do the same grow up in the same neighborhood     need to bring something in today to justify existence     officer argenis rosado   who join the precinct in        say in an interview at the station house     so now be in a small area   and day after day be hammer the same community   of course that community   eventually go to turn on     the pressure warp the way officer and resident see each other   rookie have to ignore why someone may be drink outside or sit on a stoop     some of the cop that come out at that time probably view the community differently   too     say hector espada   a    veteran of the precinct     not because want to   but because have to   because some way or somehow   can not give someone a       summon and feel like guy could still have a civil conversation after that     morale wilt in the aged station house on alexander avenue   in mott haven   officer feel pressure to downgrade crime complaint to make appear less serious   several say in interview that have overlook crime report from immigrant because be see as unlikely to complain   and watch supervisor badg victim into repeat story in hope that would drop complaint   the practice of downgrade complaint result in the disciplining of    officer in the precinct last year   one in a string of scandal that have leave officer there feel overscrutinize for problem that also exist elsewhere   four commander in the precinct be send packing in five year   one of after officer be find to be

other become reluctant to take assignment in proactive policing unit   like    that put in    situation on the street     whenever walk through the door of the precinct   to   seem like a black cloud     say russell lewis   a     of the   th     be like a heaviness   when walk in   all want to do be do   hour    minute and go home   because do not want to get catch up in anything     the precinct cover only about two square mile   but the more than a dozen housing project there mean that overflow with people   methadone clinic draw addict from around the city      loft on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification   even as the police department have hire         more officer for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism   officer in the   th precinct say could still rush to        call during a shift        a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner   james p  o neill   say be handle in a similar south bronx precinct    year ago   several dozen call at a time can be wait for a response   resident know that if want the police for a domestic problem   help to hint that there be a weapon   last year   the precinct draw the    number of civilian complaint for officer misconduct in the city   and the most lawsuit stem from police action   the precinct be try to improve morale under a new commanding officer   deputy inspector brian hennessy   a cadre of what the department call neighborhood coordination officer have be on patrol since last january   part of a citywide effort under mr  o neill and mayor bill de blasio to bring

officer say now have more discretion to resolve encounter without a summon or an arrest   at one corner near a school   on courtlandt avenue and east    st street   that have long spawn complaint about gunfire and fight   inspector hennessy and some of officer paint over graffiti and sweep up drug paraphernalia this summer   people say be the first answer to complaint in year   but the inspector acknowledge that the residue of    policing linger     that perception really stick     say   the workload in the   th precinct be startling and reveal a gap in how detective squad be equip to answer violent crime in manhattan compare with the bronx   brooklyn and queens   three of the precinct  s    detective be carry more than     case each this year   and many other have load in the high    s   even though the department advise     in violent precinct   when be assign a homicide   typically have four day to investigate before deal with other case   quieter precinct can give detective a month with little distraction to investigate a murder   detective in the   th precinct have each handle an average of    violent felony this year through          murder   rape   felony assault and robbery   by contrast   a detective in the precinct on the southern end of staten island carry nine such case a detective in the precinct patrol union square and gramercy park handle    and a detective in the precinct for most of washington heights handle      the citywide median   last year   the   th be the     for violent crime   with    case per detective   in the bronx as a

be later send to more specialized unit   but precinct detective do extensive initial work to interview victim   write report and process evidence   precinct in much of manhattan   which be whiter and wealthy than the south bronx   often have more property felony   like steal laptop or credit card   and the police say those can be complex   but even account for those crime   the   th precinct have some of the heavy caseload of overall crime per detective in the city   michael palladino   the head of the detectives   endowment association and a former bronx officer   say staffing disparity affect the department  s effort to build trust in community like the south bronx   witness make a calculation   say     if cooperate with the detective   there   so much work   there   so few of there   will not even get the chance to protect   or will be there too late when the retaliation come     sergeant lopuzzo   who turn down a more prestigious post to stay in the   th precinct   say that squad work tirelessly to handle case with the people have   and that while every squad want more detective   staffing need for counterterrorism unit and task force have create new deployment challenge across the department     fight with the army have   not the army wish have     say   detail of how the police department assign          officer be closely hold and constantly in flux   and the

more detective to the   th precinct and say the department would reassess deployment more broadly in troubled precinct   say a recent decision to bring gang   narcotic and vice detective under command make easy to shift personnel   chief boyce say the burden on detective go beyond felony crime to include    and    case   and note the support that precinct squad get from centralized unit focus on robbery   gang or grand larceny   for example   major crime keep pound the   th precinct   at rate that in      be only a tenth of a percent low than in        even as citywide crime drop by more than a third over the same period   but the precinct  s detective squad shrink by about eight investigator during those year   accord to staffing datum obtain from the city council through a freedom of information law request   the squad cover union square and gramercy park   where crime drop by a third over that period   grow by about    investigator     the   th precinct be give an additional detective and four    investigator this summer   when be already miss three detective for illness or other reason     retire detective be skeptical that community relation alone can drive down crime in the city  s last     the busy precinct   rather   say   the police department should be dedicate more resource to provide the same sort of robust investigative response that seem standard in manhattan     any crime in manhattan have to be solve     say howard landesberg   who be a   th precinct detective in the late          the outer borough be   like   forget     retire detective say that understaffing make hard to solve crime in the bronx   brooklyn and queens   where the high prevalence of gang and drug killing already saddle investigator with case in which people be not inclined to cooperate   through    detective have close    percent of homicide in manhattan and    percent of those in staten island this year   compare with    percent of those in the bronx

astonishing     pound in seven month   when get on the scale for all to see that evening   december            weigh just     pound   down from       dress in a    and    short   be lean   athletic and as handsome as a model     have get life back     declare     mean   feel like a million buck     mr  cahill leave the show  s stage in hollywood and fly directly to new york to start a triumphal tour of the talk show   chat with jay leno   regis philbin and joy behar   as hear from fan all over the world   elation know no bound   but in the year since   more than     pound have creep back onto     frame despite good effort   in fact   most of that season  s    contestant have regain much if not all the weight lose so arduously   some be even heavy now   yet experience   while a bitter personal disappointment   have be a gift to science   a study of season    s contestant have yield surprising new discovery about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight lose   kevin hall   a scientist at a federal research center who admit to a weakness for reality tv   have the idea to follow the   biggest loser   contestant for six year after that victorious night   the project be the first to measure what happen to people over as long as six year after have lose large amount of weight with intensive dieting and exercise   the result   the researcher say   be stunning   show just how hard the body fight back against weight loss     be frightening and amazing     say dr  hall   an expert on metabolism at the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases   which be part of the national institutes of health     be just blow away     have to do with rest metabolism   which determine how many calorie a person burn when at rest   when the show begin   the contestant   though hugely overweight   have normal metabolism for size   mean be burn a normal number of calorie for people of weight   when end   metabolism have slow radically and body be not burn enough calorie to maintain thin size   researcher know that just about anyone who deliberately lose weight        even if start at a normal weight or even underweight        will have a slow metabolism when the diet end   so be not surprised to see that   the biggest loser   contestant have slow metabolism when the show end   what shock the researcher be what happen next   as the year go by and the number on the scale climb   the contestant   metabolism do not recover   become even slow   and the pound keep pile on   be as if body be intensify effort to pull the contestant back to original weight   mr  cahill be one of the bad off   as regain more than     pound   metabolism slow so much that   just to maintain current weight of     pound   now have to eat     calorie a day less than a typical man size   anything more turn to fat   the struggle the contestant go through help explain why have be so hard to make headway against the nation  s obesity problem   which afflict more than a third of american adult   despite spend billion of dollar on    drug and dieting program   even the most motivated be work against own biology   experience show that the body will fight back for year   and that   say dr  michael schwartz   an obesity and diabetes researcher who be a professor of medicine at the university of washington   be   new and important       the key point be that can be on tv   can lose enormous amount of weight   can go on for six year   but can not get away from a basic biological reality     say dr  schwartz   who be not involve in the study     as long as be below initial weight   body be go to try to get back     the show   doctor   robert huizenga   say expect the contestant   metabolic rate to fall just after the show   but be hope for a small drop   question   though   whether the measurement six year later be accurate   but maintain weight loss be difficult   say   which be why tell contestant that should exercise at least nine hour a week and monitor diet to keep the weight off     unfortunately   many contestant be unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctor   psychologist   sleep specialist   and trainer        and that   something all need to work hard to change     say in an email   the study  s finding   to be publish on monday in the journal obesity   be part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental question about obesity   researcher be figure out why be fat make so many people develop diabete and other medical condition   and be search for new way to block the poison in fat   be start to unravel the reason bariatric surgery allow most people to lose significant amount of weight when diet so often fail   and be look afresh at medical care for obese people   the hope be that this work will eventually lead to new therapy that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life   most people who have try to lose weight know how hard be to keep the weight off   but many blame when the pound come back   but what obesity research have consistently show be that dieter be at the mercy of own body   which muster hormones and an alter metabolic rate to pull back to old weight   whether that be hundred of pound more or that extra    or    that many people be try to keep off   there be always a weight a person  s body maintain without any effort   and while be not know why that weight can change over the year        may be an effect of age        at any point   there be a weight that be easy to maintain   and that be the weight the body fight to defend   find a way to thwart these mechanism be the goal scientist be strive for   first   though   be try to understand in great detail   dr  david ludwig   the director of the new balance foundation obesity prevention center at boston children  s hospital   who be not involve in the research   say the finding show the need for new approach to weight control   caution that the study be limit by small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who do not lose weight   but   add   the finding make sense     this be a subset of the most successful   dieter   say     if do not show a return to normal in metabolism   what hope be there for the rest of     still   add     that should not be interpret to mean be doom to battle biology or remain fat   mean need to explore other approach     some scientist say weight maintenance have to be treat as an issue separate from weight loss   only when that challenge be solve   say   can progress truly be make against obesity     there be a lot of basic research still need to do     say dr  margaret jackson   who be direct a project at pfizer   group be test a drug that   in animal at least   act like leptin   a hormone that control hunger   with weight loss   leptin level fall and people become hungry   the idea be to trick the brain of people who have lose weight so do not become ravenous for lack of leptin   while many of the contestant keep enough weight off to improve health and become more physically active   the low weight strive to keep elude all but one of   erinn egbert   a    caregiver for mother in versailles   kentucky and struggle mightily to keep the pound off because metabolism burn     few calorie a day than would be expect for someone size     what people do not understand be that a treat be like a drug     say ms  egbert   who go from     pound to just under     on the show   and now weigh between     and         two treat can turn into a binge over a    period   that be what struggle with     six year after season   end      of the    contestant go to the n  i  h  last fall for three day of testing   the researcher be concern that the contestant may try to frantically lose weight before come in   so ship equipment to that would measure physical activity and weight before visit   and have the information send remotely to the n  i  h  the contestant receive metabolic result last week   be shock   but on further reflection   decide the number explain a lot     all friend be drink beer and not gain massive amount of weight     mr  cahill say     the moment start drink beer   there go another    pound   say     this be not right   something be wrong with body       sean algaier        a pastor from charlotte   n  c  feel cheat   go from     pound to     as a contestant on the show   now weight be up to     again   and be burn     few calorie a day than would be expect for a man size       kind of like hear have a life sentence     say   slow metabolism be not the only reason the contestant regain weight   though   constantly battle hunger   craving and binge   the investigator find at least one reason   plummet level of leptin   the contestant start out with normal level of leptin   by the season  s finale   have almost no leptin at all   which would have make ravenous all the time   as weight return   leptin level drift up again   but only to about half of what have be when the season begin   the researcher find   thus help to explain urge to eat   leptin be just one of a cluster of hormone that control hunger   and although dr  hall and colleague do not measure the rest of   another group of researcher   in a different project   do   in a    study fund by australia  s national health and medical research council   dr  joseph proietto of the university of melbourne and colleague recruit    overweight people who agree to consume just     calorie a day for eight or nine week   lose an average of nearly    pound   but over the next year   the pound start come back   dr  proietto and colleague look at leptin and four other hormone that satiate people   level of most of fall in study subject   also look at a hormone that make people want to eat   level rise     what be surprising be what a coordinated effect be     dr  proietto say     the body put multiple mechanism in place to get back to weight   the only way to maintain weight loss be to be hungry all the time   desperately need agent that will suppress hunger and that be safe with    use     mr  cahill        say weight problem begin when be in the third grade   get fat   then fat   would starve   and then eat a whole can of cake frost with a spoon   afterward   would cower in the pantry off the kitchen   feeling overwhelmed with shame   over the year   insatiable urge to eat keep overcome   and weight climb       pound                       use to look at and think     be horrible   be a monster   subhuman       say   begin sleep in a recliner because be too heavy to sleep lie down   walk hurt stair be agony   buy clothe with a    waist be humiliating     remember sit in a dressing room one day   and nothing would fit   look at the traffic outside on the street and think     should just run out in front of a car       eventually seize on   the biggest loser   as good chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life   try three time and be finally select   before the show begin   the contestant undergo medical test to be sure could endure the rigorous schedule that lie ahead   and rigorous be   sequester on the   biggest loser   ranch with the other contestant   mr  cahill exercise seven hour a day   burn         to         calorie accord to a calorie tracker the show give   take electrolyte tablet to help replace the salt lose through sweating   consume many few calorie than before   eventually   and the other be send home for four month to try to keep lose weight on own   mr  cahill set a goal of a    deficit per day   the idea be to lose a pound a day   quit job as a land surveyor to do   routine go like this   wake up at   a  m  and run on a treadmill for    minute   have breakfast        typically one egg and two egg white   half a grapefruit and a piece of sprout grain toast   run on the treadmill for another    minute   rest for    minute bike ride nine mile to a gym   work out for two and a half hour   shower   ride home   eat lunch        typically a grill skinless chicken breast   a cup of broccoli and    spear of asparagus   rest for an hour   drive to the gym for another round of exercise   if have not burn enough calorie to hit goal   go back to the gym after dinner to work out some more   at time   find run around neighborhood in the dark until    indicator reset to zero at midnight   on the day of the    on the show   finale   mr  cahill and the other dress carefully to hide the roll of loose skin that remain   to surprise and horror   after have lose weight   wear compression undergarment to hold in   mr  cahill know could not maintain finale weight of     pound   be so mentally and physically exhaust barely move for two week after publicity tour end   but have start a new career give motivational speech as the big loser ever   and for the next four year   manage to keep weight below     pound by exercise two to three hour a day   but two year ago   go back to job as a surveyor   and the pound start come back   soon the scale hit       mr  cahill start weigh and measure food again and step up exercise   get back down to     to     pound   but weight edge up again   to       then       slow metabolism be part of the problem   and so be food craving   open a bag of chip   think will have just a few     would eat five bite   then would black out and eat the whole bag of chip and say     what do do       dr  lee kaplan   an obesity researcher at harvard   say the brain set the number of calorie consume   and can be easy for people to miss that how much eat matter less than the fact that body want to hold on to more of those calorie   dr  michael rosenbaum   an obesity researcher at columbia university who have collaborate with dr  hall in previous study   say the body  s system for regulate how many calorie be consume and how many be burn be tightly couple when people be not strenuously try to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss   still   pound can insidiously creep on     eat about           to a million calorie a year   and burn all except those annoy         to         calorie that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pound     say     these very small difference between intake and output average out to only about    to    calorie per day        less than one starburst candy        but the cumulative consequence over time can be devastating       be not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of experience as age be the consequence of change in lifestyle   the environment or just the biology of aging     dr  rosenbaum add   the effect of small imbalance between calorie eat and calorie burn be more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight   dr  hall say   yes   there be signal to regain weight   but wonder how many extra calorie people be drive to eat   find a way to figure that out   analyze datum from a clinical trial in which people take a diabetes drug   canagliflozin   that make spill     calorie a day into urine   or take a placebo   the drug have no know effect on the brain   and the person do not realize those calorie be be spill   those take the drug gradually lose weight   but for every five pound lose   be   without realize   eat an additional     calorie a day   those extra calorie   dr  hall say   be a big driver of weight regain than the slowing of the metabolism   and   add   if people fight the urge to eat those calorie   would be hungry     unless continue to fight constantly   will regain the weight     say   all this do not mean that modest weight loss be hopeless   expert say   individual respond differently to diet manipulation          or    diet   for example        and to exercise and    drug   among other intervention   but dr  ludwig say that simply cut calorie be not the answer     there be no doubt exceptional individual who can ignore primal biological signal and maintain weight loss for the long term by restrict calorie     say   but add that   for most people   the combination of incessant hunger and slow metabolism be a recipe for weight regain        explaining why so few individual can maintain weight loss for more than a few month     dr  rosenbaum agree     the difficulty in keep weight off reflect biology   not a pathological lack of willpower affect    of the u  s  a      say   mr  cahill know that now   and with report from dr  hall  s group show just how much metabolism have slow   stop blame for weight gain     that shame that be on shoulder go off     say

all the country  s traditional friend   obama certainly strengthen alliance with western european nation turn off by george w  bush   and work closely with other country to fight isis and reduce climate change   but on watch tie have fray with several country previously consider u  s  partner   include egypt   israel   the philippines   saudi arabia   and turkey   the bitter     this week between u  s  and israeli leader on israel  s settlement policy be just one illustration of this trend   these tie have fray in part because of event outside obama  s control   such as the egyptian revolution and   in the case of the saudis   the american    revolution   have fray because of the emergence in many of these country of leader who be personally and ideologically at odd with obama   but have also fray because of the unique way in which the obama administration have treat adversary and ally   the prevail logic within the administration appear to go something like this   adversarial government do not want what the u  s  government want   so constructive relationship with must initially be base on opportunity for dialogue   eventually   sustained engagement may help produce or identify area of convergent interest   john kerry  s speech on the    issue     in light of the cultural revolution  s horror   nixon  s meeting with mao appear inexcusable     and yet surely help set china on a path where million of citizen have be lift from poverty and connect to open society     obama declare in accept the nobel peace prize in            w e must try as best can to balance isolation and engagement   pressure and incentive     such logic help explain why obama have say   in reference to the iran nuclear agreement   that   do not make deal like this with friend     and why   during a visit to havana   emphasize the importance of diplomacy despite many difference with the cuban government   by contrast   obama seem to believe that the united states and ally should     in an ideal world   at least     share interest and value   when an ally act in way disapprove of   obama have be more willing than recent predecessor to publicly criticize or marginalize   often this take the form of obama suggest that while the ally ultimately want what the u  s  want   be go about thing the wrong way   hence obama  s claim that and philippine president rodrigo duterte share a desire to crack down on drug trafficking   but that duterte be not do   the right way   or assertion that steadfast u  s  support for saudi arabia against iran be not good for the saudis   even though think be or advice   as a   friend and partner of turkey  s       that president recep tayyip erdogan avoid an      overreaction   after a fail coup attempt   nowhere have this tendency be more evident than in obama  s relation with israel   and specifically longstanding disagreement with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu over the nuclear deal with iran and the construction of jewish settlement in the west bank and east jerusalem   here   for instance   be how obama defend the iran accord last year   do not doubt   netanyahu  s   sincerity   but believe be wrong   believe the fact support this deal   believe be in america  s interest and israel  s interest   and as president of the united states   would be an abrogation of constitutional duty to act against good judgment simply because cause temporary friction with a dear friend and ally   do not believe that would be the right thing to do for the united states   do not believe would be the right thing to do for israel   u  s  secretary of state john kerry express a similar sentiment this week in a speech on the    conflict     friend need to tell each other the hard truth     kerry argue   and the hard truth in this case be that israeli settlement be endanger a    peace deal with the palestinians   that   why the united states have decline to veto a recent un resolution condemn israel  s settlement activity   kerry explain   this friend   the united states of america   that have do more to support israel than any other country   this friend that have block countless effort to delegitimize israel   can not be true to own value     or even the state democratic value of israel     and can not properly defend and protect israel   if allow a viable    solution to be destroy before own eye   and that   the bottom line   the vote in the united nations be about preserve the    solution   that   what be stand up for   israel  s future as a jewish and democratic state   live side by side in peace and security with neighbor   that   what be try to preserve   for sake and for   in fact   this administration have be israel  s great friend and supporter   with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advance israel  s security and protect legitimacy   these critique of ally   policy may well be justify   but often have not produce the change that obama have seek   the leader of many of these country have express resentment about the american president tell what   in own good interest   israel  s settlement construction and the philippines   brutal drug war continue apace turkey  s president be as authoritarian as ever saudi arabia remain rigidly opposed to iran   one possible explanation for this lack of progress be that   when come to inevitable disagreement with ally   obama have occupy a middle ground between the relatively gentle public prodding of recent predecessor and the unpredictable iconoclasm of donald trump   trump   like obama   have at time be quite critical of traditional u  s  ally   but   unlike obama   trump do not seem to be especially concerned about ally share u  s  value   or to expect ally to broadly share u  s  interest want to partner with vladimir putin even though do not   happen to like   the russian political   system     and routinely accuse u  s  ally of exploit america  s generosity in pursuit of own selfish goal   and   unlike obama   trump have suggest that may seriously consider alternative to these alliance arrangement should criticism not be address     that the united states could   say   withdraw security commitment to japan or nato country if do not invest more in own defense   these position have introduce destabilize uncertainty into america  s intricate alliance system   but also play a role in japan  s prime minister hop on the first plane to trump tower   and nato  s european member ramp up military spending   shortly after trump  s election   obama   on the other hand   typically pair criticism of ally with a restatement of strong commitment to the alliance   this be the complicated legacy the president leave behind   have succeed in forge deal with hostile nation after decade of estrangement   and emphasize the importance of collaborate with ally to address international challenge   while nevertheless leave a number of ally feel estranged     premature to assess obama  s tenure the bet   place will take year to pay off   but leave office amid sign   however faint   that trump could be more effective at change the behavior of some american ally than obama   who often value those alliance too much to jeopardize

53127,73213,Does Anyone Know What to Make of Obama’s Sanctions?,Atlantic,David A. Graham,2016-12-30,2016.0,12.0,,what be a bewilder citizen to make of the sanction that president obama levy on russian official and the russian government on thursday   the confusion start with the news coverage   the associated press   for example   blare that   president barack obama have slap harsh sanction on the russian intelligence service     meanwhile the former head of the cia  s russia operation tell the new york times     think these sanction be pretty weak     more perhaps symbolic     some sloppy report even suggest   wrongly   that russian agent have interfere with vote count or vote machine   try to follow partisan cue will not help either   as     in what be emerge as a hallmark of the donald trump era     the traditional alliance on foreign policy within and between the party be scramble and break   across party line   various voice seem unable to decide whether to blame russia for hack that intelligence official say be intend to interfere with the      election   likely to aid trump   nor on how to react appropriately to that hacking   the    issue a nebulous statement thursday afternoon   which be evidently a response to obama  s sanction   though do not make any explicit connection       time for country to move on to big and well thing     trump say     nevertheless   in the interest of country and great people   will meet with leader of the intelligence community next week in order to be update on the fact of this situation     like many trump statement   this one raise as many question as answer   if   time to move on   why bother meeting   if   important   why have wait so long   why have be decline so many intelligence briefing   give that trump have be brief on the hack   what may hear that would induce to change mind   on friday   trump tweet more praise for putin   apparently laud for not immediately retaliate after the sanction   though wording be unclear   great move on delay   by v  putin      always know be very smart   in any event   be an example of the    support a foreign autocrat over the u  s  government     an example of the reality that colleague uri friedman identify last week   in which there be effectively duel american president   the reaction among trump  s inner circle remain splintered too   kellyanne conway   a senior adviser   dismiss the sanction as   largely symbolic     and say that russian intelligence do not keep asset in the united states   a judgment that one    reporter openly mock     at least may have the excuse of not be brief   unlike boss     on the other hand   john bolton   whose name seem to have sink somewhat in the sweepstake for a trump state department appointment   who be see just a couple week ago complain that the intelligence be so shaky that the attack could well have be a    operation   now say that obama should have do much more to   make the russians feel the pain     the heritage foundation   the conservative institution that have largely append to the trump team   produce a short video charge that obama have invite the hacking by be too lenient with russia   vladimir putin respect two thing   strength and consistency in the last eight year   president obama have show neither   pic   twitter         time to deal with russia from a position of strength     the video conclude   take a similar position be jack kingston   a former u  s  representative and current trump adviser   who tweet     putin outplay obama again   obama embarrass on the way out the door     senate majority leader mitch mcconnell also portray obama  s sanction as too little and too late     sanction against the russian intelligence service be a good initial step   however late in come     say in a statement     as the next congress review russian action against network associate with the u  s  election   must also work to ensure that any attack against the united states be meet with an overwhelming response       mcconnell have be attempt a difficult dance     with one hand   push back on demand for a special committee to investigate the hack   while use the other to insist that despite what trump say   the intelligence community be reliable     most republican member of congress seem to be in mcconnell  s general vicinity   and worry about the threat of foreign power interfere with electoral process   this create a potential collision between and the trump administration early on   despite the good effort of people like mcconnell to build unity   after all   express concern over hacking and ask for an inquiry be diametrically oppose to trump  s view that probably be not the russians   and even if be     time to move on   some conservative have spend the last eight year complain that obama have be too accommodate of russia   but the reaction from heritage   bolton   mcconnell   and other carry the implication that trump will take a hard line   to call that expectation unsupported would be an understatement   the    spend the presidential campaign promise friendly relation with russia suggest would recognize the illegal annexation of crimea nominate a vocal critic of sanction on the kremlin as a secretary of state and so on   then there   representative trent franks   an arizona republican   who argue that maybe russia be responsible   and maybe   not     but that if be   that   not such a bad thing       if russia succeed in give the american people information that be accurate   then merely do what the medium should have do     franks say on msnbc thursday     be not the only person to make this case     do not take an advanced degree to see the problem with this statement   one can defend the press  s decision to cover the hack material   and even celebrate the effect of the hack material   without invite foreign power to hack into the email of political leader   or those of the nation  s top diplomat   as trump do during the campaign     obama be indeed tardy to the role of hawk in    relation   but on the left   particularly   the farther leave   there   concern that be     glenn greenwald point out that there   a long history of american intelligence mislead both the public and elect official   though greenwald also believe the hack should be fully investigate   the skepticism of intelligence sourcing be    though one question that loom over the debate be precisely what evidence would convince a doubter like trump of russian involvement   short of video footage of putin write malware   there   grow consensus that evidence point to russian actor in the hack   although there be less public proof that be intend to aid trump   in any case   there   no good argument to make against ask for strong evidence   even if trump  s ally keep try to make one   not every critique be quite so carefully think out   for those who criticize wikileaks for not publish rnc email or more putin doc   why do not just publish yourself   this rather seem to be beg the question if wikileaks do as allege receive the dnc document thank to russian state actor   then have a unique source   any news organization able to get hand on putin doc or rnc email would almost certainly publish     please   send here     the nation   which have in recent year tend to view any criticism of russia     include of expansionist impulse     as a resurgence of mccarthyism   see in this case yet another sign that there   a new cold war brewing   the danger of nuclear war   and the malign effect on political discourse within the united states   be no less horrifying than be    year ago   the specter of the u  s  expel russian official as personae non grata on thursday be straight out of the cold war playbook of action and reaction   even if some commentator seem to be unaware of the old    ritual of allow some suspect spy to stay in the country just so there be someone to throw out in a crisis   but the rejection of any criticism of russia have serious shortcoming   label critique of putin  s russia as nothing more than mccarthyism will come as little consolation to russian dissident be crush by putin   and what if   prove that russia do hack to interfere with the election   should these fear paralyze the united states and prevent from respond   meanwhile   an entirely different faction on the left be argue that trump be all but   or maybe simply be   a      kremlin agent   the only person who seem to be enjoy all of this be putin   if do in fact direct the hack in an attempt to help trump   then   a huge win   trump pull off the upset   and now get a friendly leader in washington   if direct the hack in order to create chaos among american policymaker   then get that too   and even if russia be totally uninvolved   benefit from all of these dynamic   and will still have a friendly leader in the white house come january      the disorder in washington have give putin the opportunity to pose as the serene statesman   regard the scene with equanimity   putin announce that would not expel any american diplomat   despite the public recommendation of foreign minister sergei lavrov     this seem possibly choreograph     even invite the child of american diplomat to a bash at the kremlin     a    troll   not for some time have putin have such an opportunity to gloat     also just manage to strike a    deal in syria   at least as long as hold   but russia remain much diminish from cold war peak   economy be in shamble   a state of affair likely to persist even if trump remove sanction   especially if the price of oil remain low   jeet heer be not the first to point out   despite what seem to believe   that the late    have a pedigree   russia remain angry about u  s  move to expand nato into eastern europe in the year after the soviet union   and for support of    activist in russia and other former soviet republic   which regard as finance effort to overthrow government   but successive u  s  president have enter office seek well relation with the kremlin   in june of        george w  bush meet with the    russian president and infamously declare     look the man in the eye   find very    and trustworthy     be able to get a sense of soul     but bush come to infuriate putin with american support of the   color revolution   in eastern europe in the    and at the very end of bush  s term   putin spite by seize georgian territory   obama enter office promise well relation than predecessor   infamously dispatch    of state hillary clinton to present a   reset   button to lavrov   that effort come to naught   too   with putin seize crimea   intervene on behalf of bashar    in syria   and allegedly oversee hack to interfere with the election   trump now say be the one to shepherd close relation   one possible takeaway from this sequence be not that the united states and russia be on the brink of a new cold war   but rather than the old one never really end

vicinity of the bull     opponent would not even acknowledge the target exist        except in the most grudging of way   and only because trump have force the issue   the question boil down to this   be willing to name the enemy   trump force the issue into the light of day   and once do        voil           what be yesterday  s   islamophobia   become today  s conventional wisdom   in reality   be never either of these thing   the former be an    smear   a wildly successful one   to scare off examination of the enemy the latter be frequently wrong   what cassandras have really be try to highlight be a simple fact   as patent as be unremarkable from the time of sun tsu until the      world trade center bombing   to defeat the enemy   must know the enemy        who be   what motivate   what be try to achieve   be willing to name the enemy be a start   but be just a start        the beginning   not the end   of understanding   the speech provide reason for hope   for one thing   trump compare   radical islamic terrorism   to the    challenge of fascism   nazism   and communism   these be ideological enemy   the capacity to project force be by no means the totality of the threat each represent        which be why be so foolish to be dismissive of today  s enemy just because jihadist network can not compare militarily to nazi germany or the soviet union   furthermore   toward the end of speech   trump use   radical islamic terrorism   interchangeably with   radical islam     end the spread of radical islam   say   must be objective   even refer to as an   ideology          though call an   ideology of death     which miss the point be an ideology of conquest   trump intimate some understanding of this   too   vow to   speak out against the oppression of woman

because of ideological tenet that call for dominion by sharia   islam  s ancient totalitarian law   be those tenet that reformer be try to reform   in sum   trump show sign of awareness that there be more than bomb   hijack plane   weaponize truck   and jihadist gunman to confront   still   focus be terrorist        specifically isis   which claim be create by    policy   while clearly know there be more to the threat than isis   explicitly add only    and     hamas and hezbollah     to the contrary   isis be a breakaway faction of    that exist before barack obama come to power   hamas   though certainly support by shiite iran   be a sunni terrorist organization spawn by the muslim brotherhood   more crucially   all of the group trump list   and the regime that sponsor   be create by the ideology   while will go with   radical islam     the ideology be more accurately describe as   sharia supremacism          alas   in the part of the world trump be talk about     radical islam   be not so radical   be the ideology that create jihadist group and regime   not american policy   no matter how clueless and counterproductive policy have be at time   if isis and    disappear tomorrow   other jihadist network would take place   will be that way until sharia supremacism be discredit and marginalize   that be a tall order   not to be underestimate   the audience in which the ideology must be discredit be not western do not share value system        sense of what be credible and meritorious   plus   the sharia that enemy strive to implement   i  e    jihad in allah  s way     be undeniably root in islamic scripture   will not be easy        may not be possible        to discredit a literalist construction of islam that have be back by revere scholar for    century   that be why some detractor of islam argue with considerable force that should stop mince word   if the problem be root in islamic doctrine   contend   then the problem be islam   not   radical islam     yet this overlook significant fact   there be fierce intramural islamic debate about doctrinal interpretation   own    experience tell that doctrine and religious practice can evolve   belief system   moreover   be ultimately about more than doctrine   culture count for a great deal   yes   sharia supremacism be pretty much the same wherever go   and become more aggressive and threatening as adherent increase in number   but the understanding and practice of islam vary from riyadh to cairo to kabul to ankara to jakarta to tirana to london   there be   furthermore   an     reality of much great moment than theological infighting   a large percentage of the world  s approximately       billion muslims reject sharia supremacism   many of provide with essential help in fight the enemy   to condemn islam   rather than those who seek to impose islam  s rule system on   can only alienate ally   be ally need in an ideological conflict   the sensible strategy   therefore   call for support the islamic reformer    trump say want to befriend   that would be an epic improvement over outreach to islamists   whom government have inanely court and empower for a     to the extent can   and that may be limit   should support the reinterpretation of what egyptian president abdel fattah    courageously acknowledge as   the corpus of text and idea that   muslims   have sacralize over the century   to the point that depart from have become almost impossible   even though be   antagonize the entire world     sisi   be worth note   be a devout muslim who know a lot more about islam than barack obama and john kerry do   in any event     well to confront with open eye the scripturally root ideological foundation of radical islam   as have see over the last three presidential administration   or the last six   if want to go back to carter and khomeini  s revolution   pretend that the ideology do not exist   or that represent a   false islam     be fantasy   as a    strategy   fantasy be a prescription for failure   have be the obama prescription   right up to the end   while candidate trump be demand that the enemy be name   and    hillary be thus goad into the occasional mention of   jihadist     obama try to defend refusal to invoke radical islam   the defense be classic obama   part one be flat wrong     there   no religious rationale     maintain   that would justify   the   barbarism   in which terrorist engage        something that could only be right if ignore scripture and adopt obama  s eccentric notion of   religious rationale     part two draw on obama  s bottomless supply of straw man     use the phrase   radical islam       lecture   will not make the terrorist threat   go away          as if anyone have claim would   the point   of course   be not that there be talismanic power in utter an enemy  s identity   be to convey   to the enemy and to an anxious american public   that leader comprehend who the enemy be   what the enemy  s objective be   and what drive the enemy to achieve   obviously   obama be too smart not to know this   after eight infuriate year   be beyond try to fathom whether intentional gibberish mask some misguide but    strategy   some dogma to which be hopelessly beholden   or something more sinister   the imperative now be to address the mess be leave behind   not unwind how and why come to make   this week   obama betray israeli ally by orchestrate   and cravenly abstain from   a u  n  security council resolution   as have explain   the ostensible purpose of the resolution be to condemn the construction of israeli settlement in the dispute territory of east jerusalem   judea   and samaria that israel have control since      the real purpose be to declare that those territory be sovereign palestinian land   and thus that israel be   occupy   in violation of international law     international law   be the    term for the    intensely    security council  s       what do this have to do with enemy  s ideology   everything   the palestinians and the islamist regime that support frame struggle against israel in term of islamic obligation   hamas   the aforementioned muslim brotherhood branch that have be lavishly support by saudi arabia   iran   turkey   and other muslim government   be more explicit about this than rival for palestinian leadership   fatah   but both be clear on the matter   take the doctrinal position that any territory that come under islamic control for any duration of time be islam  s forever     that   why islamist still refer to spain as    and vow to retake   notwithstanding that lose half a millennium ago     further   radical islam regard the presence of a sovereign jewish state in islamic territory as an intolerable affront   again   the reason be doctrinal   do not take word for have a look at the      hamas charter     the covenant of the islamic resistance movement       article     in particular   include this statement by the prophet muhammad   the day of judgement will not come about until muslims fight the jews   kill the jews   when the jew will hide behind stone and tree   the stone and tree will say     o muslims   o abdulla   there be a jew behind   come and kill             relate by    and muslim     understand      and muslim be authoritative collection of hadith   these memorialization of the prophet  s saying and deed have scriptural status in islam   hamas be not lie        this story of an     annihilation of jews be relate   repeatedly   in islamic scripture     see   e  g  here     and please spare the twaddle about how there be compete interpretation that discount or   contextualize   these hadith   do not matter which   if any   interpretation represent the   true islam     if there be one     what matter for purpose of security be that million of muslims   include enemy   believe these hadith mean what say        unalterable   for all time   even after all the    attack have endure over the last few decade   and for all claptrap about respect islam as   one of the world  s great religion     transnational progressive can not bring to accept that something as pass  as religious doctrine could dictate    conflict   so   tell   the israeli     palestinian conflict be simply about territorial boundary and refugee right   could be settle if israel   which reckon would never have be establish but for a regrettable bout of    remorse   would just make a few concession regard land be never cede in the first place   conveniently overlook that east jerusalem and the west bank be dispute territory   and be not   palestinian   when israel take in the      war of arab aggression     transnational progressive see israel as intransigent   notwithstanding many attempt to trade land for peace   rationalize palestinian terrorism as the product of that intransigence   not of ideology   thus smug calculation that brand israel as an   occupier   of   palestinian land   in gross   violation of international law   be the nudge israel need to settle   this will effectively grant the palestinians covet sovereign state   thus accommodate   palestinians will surely moderate and    with israel        if not in peace   then in the same uneasy state in which parisians coexist with banlieue and berliner with refugee   be not just fantasy but willfully blind idiocy   no one who take a few minute to understand the ideology of radical islam would contemplate for a moment a resolution such as the one obama just choreograph   under islamic law   the palestinians regard all of the territory        not just east jerusalem   judea   and samaria but all of israel        as muslim territory   furthermore   deem the presence of a    state on that territory as anathema   a security council resolution that declare israeli control of the dispute territory not merely an   obstacle to peace   but illegitimate tell the islamists that jihad have succeed   that    power accede to    demand   can only encourage to continue jihad toward ultimate regional goal of eradicate the jewish state   after all   mahmoud abbas have state racist term   not a single israeli will be permit to reside in the palestinian state   as islamist see   and why should not     obama  s reaction be not to condemn abbas be to appease abbas   as islamists see   allah be reward fidelity to islamic doctrine of course will persevere in   be not merely in a shoot war with jihadist   be in an ideological war with sharia supremacist   mass murder be not sole tactic attack at the negotiating table   in the council of government   in the medium   on the campus   in the courtroom        at every political and cultural pressure point   to defeat jihadist   be necessary to discredit the ideology that catalyze   do not discredit an ideology by ignore existence   deny power   and accommodate at every turn   president obama never get this   will president trump   in campaign   trump make a welcome

within the game to promote at the level a basketball player can   there really be a problem   golf should be accentuate own    property   not ship in from elsewhere   also remain curious that sport

struggle        player rather than a     multimillionaire who can snap finger and have sponsor fawn   in many respect this be the opposite of the work model web   com tour should represent   should

will inevitably endure embarrassment amid criticism of why be there in the first place   should the opposite transpire   the sense will be that golf be an easy environment     obviously want to play well and see how handle tournament golf     curry say     no expectation except keep the ball out of the gallery and not go happy gilmore     this be not to say golf should shun celebrity      event provide a regular backdrop to tournament   thereby afford people from across the sporting spectrum to see golfer at work   curry say after a round in the company of justin thomas and other in

those    beatific instructor   worry that the people in the class could fold up like origami and would fold up like a bread stick   understand the need for stretchy clothe but not for total anatomical disclosure   but hip joint hurt and so do shoulder   and upper back hurt even more than low back and brain would   not   shut   up   ask doctor about medication and say do not like the side effect and be pretty sure would not   either   so sign up for gentle mind and body yoga   the    of yoga class   think the principle be that get into some pose that have cosmic implication and then hold the pose until be enlighten or bore silly   like the bridge pose   where lie flat on back and put a rubber block under butt   purely hate the eagle pose   where wind arm around each other and then wrap leg around each other and stand on one foot drop like a spray mosquito   the teacher be forgiving     yogi  s choice     say   mean that be now a yogi and can do what want   say be not try to get anywhere   and deeply appreciate not try to get anywhere   enjoy a stretchy pose where sit with a knee cross over a leg and the opposite arm wrap around the knee but the point be   say the teacher   to wring

129972,195429,Why Google co-founder Larry Page is pouring millions into flying cars,Vox,Timothy B.

reach   airplane have long be too big   expensive   dangerous   loud   and complex for personal aviation to be more than a hobby for rich people       but that may be about to change     there   a couple of technology that be mature and converge   to make small   affordable airplane feasible   say brian german   an aerospace researcher at georgia tech   german argue that light and more powerful electric motor   battery that can store more energy   and more sophisticated aviation software could transform the market for small aircraft   indeed   several company be already work on prototype of    airplane that could soon become cheap   safe   and versatile enough for ordinary people to use regularly   google    larry page have secretly fund one startup in this market   zee aero   since        in      also invest in another call kitty hawk   lead by former google    car guru sebastian thrun       the fly car of the future will not look exactly like the one on the jetsons   there   a good chance will rent on demand from a company like uber instead of buy one that park in driveway        a possibility uber explore in a recent white paper   but a future where million of people take short trip by air on a regular basis could be close than think       silicon valley innovation be spill over into aviation a conventional airplane take off horizontally   build up enough speed for the wing to carry skyward   that mean a normal airplane need a long runway to take off and land   vertical takeoff and landing aircraft   by contrast   take off vertically like a helicopter   then switch to fly horizontally once be in the air   that allow to take off and land in location where conventional airplane can not   vtol airplane be not a new technology        craft like the harrier and the    osprey have be around since the        but these airplane have never be very practical   be complex and expensive   and require pilot with specialized training to fly       but a shift from internal combustion engine to electric motor dramatically change this equation   electric motor can be much light   simple   and cheap than traditional aircraft engine power by fossil fuel        and be get light and more powerful every year   and that open up a lot of new opportunity for airplane designer   to see what the small      aircraft of the future may look like   check out this image from a patent filing by zee aero   the    startup   show a tiny personal airplane not much wide than a conventional parking space   can get a sense of scale from this photograph of a man stand next to a prototype                 take a lot more thrust for an aircraft to take off vertically than do to keep the aircraft move once   in the air   so zee aero  s design have eight vertical propeller that be use for takeoff   while there be just two in the back to provide horizontal thrust   once the plane be soar through the sky   the eight vertical propeller can be turn off to save power       this kind of design would not work with conventional aircraft engine because    engine would be way too heavy   but electric motor can be make extremely small and light   allow even a    vehicle to have    of   of course   electric motor be not a new invention   but have gradually get light and more powerful over time   beyond that   have take rapid progress in two other area to make vtol vehicle practical   battery and aviation software   the big advantage of traditional airplane fuel be that can pack a lot of energy into a small package   minimize the amount of weight airplane have to carry and allow to travel long distance without refueling     right now   battery that could actually put in an airplane would not let fly very far     german say     but give a few more year   and the writing  s on the wall that will be able to make a very practical aircraft     improvement in battery technology be a spillover benefit of innovation elsewhere in silicon valley   the burgeon market for laptop   smartphone   tablet   and electric car have inspire company to pour billion of dollar into well battery technology   as a result   the energy density of battery have be improve steadily   and each time battery improve   electric airplane can be a little light and fly a little farther on a single charge   german say battery technology be not quite there yet   predict the energy density of battery will need to approximately double for small electric airplane to really take off       battery do not improve as rapidly as computer chip   so   hard to say exactly how quickly battery will improve   tesla ceo elon musk   who be currently build a giant battery factory   have say that battery density typically improve by   to   percent per year   which imply that density could double in the next decade        though that could require find new battery chemistry   the other key breakthrough be well software   an airplane with    propeller be just too complex for a human pilot to manage effectively   but computer software can easily manage    propeller at once   supply power to the propeller where the most thrust be need   and german say    design have significant safety advantage     if lose one   still have some left     say     can design a lot of redundancy     the combination of small   more powerful electric motor   well battery   and sophisticated software will open up dramatically new possibility for aircraft design   focus on zee aero  s    design above   but there be lot of other prototype under development   the volocopter look a lot like a giant quadcopter drone        except that have    propeller instead of the four will find on a normal quadcopter   joby aviation be work a    airplane design that have    propeller for takeoff        four on the wing and four on the tail        that fold up once the aircraft be airborne   switch to four additional propeller optimize for horizontal flight               and of course   this be still a young field   if this technology do become mainstream   the successful design may look very different from these early prototype       tiny electric airplane could transform air travel on own   swap conventional aircraft engine for electric motor could have significant benefit   reduce the cost of air travel and emission per flight   but the big opportunity here be to make air travel practical in situation where no one would think to take an airplane today   back in october   uber publish a white paper describe vision of the future small vtol aircraft could make possible   uber envision a network of    aircraft carry passenger among many landing spot distribute throughout a metropolitan area   for example   right now take at least an hour to drive from san jose   california   to san francisco        and closer to two hour during rush hour   in contrast   uber estimate   the same trip could take    minute in a vtol airplane   uber estimate that the trip would initially cost around         a cost that would fall to      within a few year and could eventually cost as little as        that compare favorably to the more than       would cost to take a cab over the same route   and because these aircraft can take off and land vertically   would not require    airport at each end   vehicle could take off and land in small   vertiport   that could fit in a suburban parking lot or the top floor of an urban parking garage   and naturally   uber envision an    model where user book a flight with smartphone minute before arrive at a vertiport       at first   vtol aircraft be likely to have human pilot who steer the vehicle   sophisticated software could control many routine aspect of the flight   allow people to become pilot with less training than require today   in the long run   will likely be possible to dispense with pilot altogether and have the aircraft fly   this will not only save the cost of the pilot  s salary but will also reduce the vehicle  s weight and thereby further improve efficiency and low cost   that could lead to significant change in traffic pattern   could accelerate suburban sprawl   as affluent people buy land far from downtown and commute to work by air   affordable    air travel could make easy for city dweller to take day and weekend trip to town in the surround countryside   in the long run   concern about congestion and noise could create a bottleneck for widespread use of the technology   vtol aircraft be likely to be significantly less noisy than a helicopter   but would still be annoying to live next door to a vertiport with hundred of flight take off every hour   and even if the cost of operate a fly car get cheap enough that    people can afford   there may simply not be enough space in the sky directly overhead major metropolitan area to accommodate more than a fraction of the demand   obviously   be still several year away        at least        from commercial      fly car service   but be also well beyond the point of idle speculation   a number of startup have build work prototype   and big company like uber have begin to study this market and consider how may participate in   so sometime in the next decade or two   expect to start see small      airplane buzz around in the sky overhead  
129973,195430,President Obama just took unprecedented steps to punish Russia for its cyberattacks,Vox,Zeeshan Aleem,2016/12/29,2016.0,12.0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/12/29/14117236/obama-russia-sanctions-cyber-attacks,  us intelligence agency believe that this year russia mount an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the american electoral process in an effort to undermine american democracy and ensure the election of    donald trump       on thursday   the obama administration announce an equally unprecedented effort to punish moscow with sanction for past hack        and serve notice that future meddling will draw an even harsh response   the move   which be far more sweeping than the punishment level against north korea or china for other    hack effort   be go to make significantly harder for trump to start tenure in the white house with an immediate effort to improve tie with vladimir putin      whom the sanction target the sanction take aim at two of russia  s major intelligence agency        the fsb   the main successor agency to the    kgb   and the gru   the russian military intelligence agency        which be accuse of hack the democratic national committee  s server and the email account of clinton campaign chair john podesta to steal and then release information damage to democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton   many of clinton  s supporter believe that obama should have release information about the russia hack earlier so that would have have time to respond and highlight moscow  s apparent desire to boost trump  s chance       obama also target individual that allegedly play a leadership role in order the cyberattack   igor valentinovich korobov   the current chief of the gru   sergey aleksandrovich gizunov   deputy of the gru   igor olegovich kostyukov   a first deputy chief of the gru   and vladimir stepanovich alexseyev   also a first deputy chief of the gru       there will also be sanction against three russian company that the administration believe aid the cyberattack   two individual who be accuse of hack into    company and steal million from american financial institution will be target as well        in statement   obama also hint that there be more to come   likely in the form of unannounced cyber warfare         the sanction be mainly symbolic still   seem doubtful that the new measure will frighten putin into change behavior   some lawmaker have press obama to embarrass the russian leader by release detail of the ten of billion of dollar that and close ally be believe to have squirrele away in a labyrinth of offshore bank account   but the white house do not do so     also enormously doubtful that the gru official target by the sanction keep any asset in us bank or would want to travel here anytime soon      in a separate        but clearly related        statement   the obama administration order    russian diplomat to leave the country within    hour   which say be a response to the harassment of us diplomatic personnel in russia   also say that as of noon on friday   russians would be deny access to russian government     own compound in maryland and new york that use for     purpose       in a statement on the sanction   obama say that   all americans should be alarm     and make clear that believe the hack be nothing less than a direct order from the kremlin     these datum theft and disclosure activity could only have be direct by the high level of the russian government     say        russia  s response to obama  s move have be strike       on friday   russian foreign minister sergey lavrov publicly recommend that russia expel    us diplomat and shut down two us diplomatic facility as a      but hour later   putin say that no such act of retaliation be go to happen        will not create problem for us diplomat   will not expel anyone   will not forbid family and child to use usual recreation place during the new year  s celebration     say putin   and go a step further   invite the child of us diplomat to join traditional christmas party in the kremlin   why do russia deviate from typical diplomatic protocol of      putin be prepare for trump to take office   reserve the right to respond to the us for sanction in the future   but say that would refrain from do so until trump show card on russia policy       further step towards the restoration of    relation will be build on the basis of the policy carry out by the administration of president trump     say a statement from the kremlin       the divide between obama and trump be big than ever in a statement in response to the announcement of the sanction   trump sound nonchalant about the entire issue   say       time for country to move on to big and well thing     but indicate that plan to   meet with leader of the intelligence community next week in order to be update on the fact of this situation     so far   trump have consistently express skepticism about us intelligence agency   assessment that russia launch the cyberattack to tip the election in favor   and say as recently as wednesday that the entire domain of cyber warfare be too complex for to even be curious about        think ought to get on with life     say     think that computer have complicate life very greatly   the whole age of   the   computer have make where nobody know exactly what be go on     a trump ally make an even more outlandish comment thursday   argue that russia may have do the us a service by release the steal document       if russia succeed in give the american people information that be accurate   then merely do what the medium should have do     rep  trent franks     say on msnbc     obama have set up the new penalty by executive order        which mean that if trump want to reverse   can do so with the stroke of a pen   and without the    of congress   but   not really that simple       trump face a dilemma on russia policy trump be now in an awkward position   on one hand     indicate that want to warm    relation and gain putin  s trust   and lift these new sanction would be the easy way to get that process start   but if decide to lift the measure   will be reject the unanimous and explicit finding of the intelligence agency oversee       also likely to face pushback from russia hawk in own party   sens   john mccain and lindsey graham release a joint statement thursday argue that the obama sanction do not go far enough   describe as a   small price for russia to pay     and pledge to lead an effort in congress to impose strong sanction on russia use legislation      house speaker paul ryan similarly endorse obama  s move as   overdue   and say that russia   have consistently seek to undermine   the us        both comment at odd with trump  s jarringly soft public statement about moscow     obama have order a comprehensive review of    hacking that go back to        there be not an official date for release   and   unclear how much of will be declassify   but be expect to be complete before obama leave office   and all the democratic senator on the senate intelligence committee have urge to declassify the finding relate to russia  s action during the      election   regardless of what obama choose to do   impose the sanction will have one immediate and unmistakable effect   box trump in so will have a hard time cozye up to the foreign leader who seem to have work hard to ensure would win the presidency  
129974,195431,The DNC race has become another fight over Bernie Sanders when Dems need it least,Vox,Jeff Stein,2016/12/30,2016.0,12.0,http://www.vox.com/2016/12/30/14062696/dnc-ellison-sanders,  minnesota rep  keith ellison have not be campaign for chair of the democratic national committee for more than a week before veteran party official begin publicly say would not have time to both hold the position and serve as a congressman       ellison then announce that would step down from congress if win the dnc race   but almost as soon as do so   a new chorus of objection to candidacy begin   top democratic source tell reporter be grow concerned about ellison  s alleged tie to the nation of islam and radical black muslim organizer in the     s   to ellison  s supporter        largely from the bernie sanders wing of the party        these attack look like ugly smear cynically deploy to derail candidate   but have also make ellison  s backer feel like be    an elusive foe        that opponent be throw up objection in bad faith rather than plainly identify problem with belief or propose platform for the party   frustration be     the      democratic primary between sanders and hillary clinton see major substantive divide   there be huge and obvious gap between the candidate over taxis   foreign policy   healthcare   and a host of other critical policy issue       the race for dnc chair   by contrast   have become largely a power struggle between faction        but one lack a clear contrast of idea        many democrats skeptical of sander have rally behind tom perez   one of the most progressive member of the obama cabinet   make perez the alternative to ellison may be intend as an olive branch to grassroots progressive   but could also backfire badly   by exacerbate sander   ally distrust of a party that need support now more than ever   ellison emerge early as a unity choice shortly after ellison announce dnc chair candidacy   sander quickly endorse   so do sen  elizabeth warren   who be typically see as ideologically align with sander but who do not endorse in the primary   so do the president of the american federation of teachers and the american federation of state   county   and municipal employee        two of the big and most politically influential    union   that set the stage for a potential ideological battle that would set a range of progressive force that have diverse view on the primary against someone from the more centrist wing of the party         ellison be also endorse by chuck schumer   a clinton endorser who frequently typify the kind of close tie to wall street that sanders criticize   but who be try to wield together a unify democratic senate caucus to do battle with donald trump   schumer back ellison seem continuous with a large strategy in which sander and some democratic party leader be seek a rapprochement that will shepherd as many of sander   grassroots supporter as possible into the democratic party tent   poll show that sander remain very popular with the public   and have amass a hardcore following that include both    ideologue and    voter who like that sander reject   establishment   politician   but as discover in philadelphia when interview sander  s voter at the dnc convention   sander can not merely declare that everyone should back democrats and expect all fan to follow        some be even quick to call a turncoat merely for endorse clinton       one concession have be a new post for sander in the party  s senate leadership   give the dnc chair position to ellison   who endorse sanders and have be loyal to the vermont senator  s cause   fit this pattern   and   one reason sanders have be press hard and devoting time to campaign with ellison   help sell the argument to berners who remain skeptical that the democratic party be the right vessel for agenda   the dnc chairship loom large in bernieworld the dnc chair position loom large        perhaps large than should        in the mind of sanders supporter   many sander supporter believe that former dnc chair debbie    help stack the deck against sander        and that this be a key reason sander lose the primary   few people outside the    sander circle think this be true   but to an extent that   the point   precisely because many democrats think sander supporter overstate the institutional power of the dnc chair   this be a smart concession to make to   put an unassailable sanders ally at helm be an easy way to demonstrate that the party be reform and no longer   rig          especially if do not believe be ever rig in the first place   the emergence of tom perez mute ideological conflict the most obvious alternative to a stalwart progressive like ellison would have be for sander   critic in the democratic party to elevate a    of the party  s more moderate wing   missouri secretary of state jason kander   for example   run far ahead of hillary clinton in the red state and would have be a plausible centrist alternative to ellison     instead   ellison  s strong opponent look to be perez   four democratic governor be back     receive endorsement from a few labor union   and some sander ally   bolster by report from the new york times   feel the perez boom be be fuel by obama  s political team        though the white house deny this     but perez do not present much of an ideological break from ellison   be an ardent foe of the iraq war within week of be declare   have longstanding connection to the labor movement and the   fight for        minimum wage campaign     widely consider obama  s most liberal cabinet member   union leader have love work       nor be state agenda   both gear toward more comprehensive and more granual organizing   particularly different   perez call for a dnc strategy in every zip code   while ellison have call for one in every county   ellison ally be attack perez for support the      partnership trade deal as a member of the obama cabinet   ellison   like the vast majority of congressional democrats   oppose from the beginning   the pact be   however   completely dead and in a practical sense perez have no alternative to back boss on this question   in many way what really aggravate sander   ally about the push for perez be the very absence of any kind of clear strategic or ideological gap between perez and ellison   if a big part of the case for ellison be that instal a    sander ally at the dnc would help unify the party   then the essence of the case for perez seem to be a desire to freeze sander   circle out   a perez win will likely fuel more bitterness in almost any other context perez  s ascension to the dnc chairmanship would be herald as a major victory for the party  s progressive wing   have hillary clinton win the election   for example   progressive group be prepare to press to tap perez for    or some other    role     but this race be not happen in a vacuum      perez   ellison be both strong candidate   imo the party need someone unapologetic   innovative   very left   dedicate to a diverse base   https              jill filipovic    jillfilipovic   december               a perez win now would be see as a major insult to sander and supporter   precisely because there be not an overt policy void between the two lead contender   the perez candidacy look to sanders backer like an effort to punish ellison for have support sander in the primary        or   at the very least   to make sure that those connect to sander personally be shut out of power     that   in turn   reignite old grievance from the primary about interest group be pressure to endorse clinton        even though sander   record on issue be solid        out of fear of reprisal   many bernie loyalist believe that this kind of hardball politic        pair perhaps with bias at the dnc        be the reason that sander lose the primary   and also believe that sander would have win in november   in view   this be exactly the kind of   rig   establishment politic that put trump in the white house   and now a shadowy cabal of insider want to do again        clinton supporter find this chain of reason preposterous        often so preposterous that do not recognize many people believe   but do   ellison as chair would go a long way toward redress the grievance accumulate up over month of a long      primary   perez as chair would almost certainly exacerbate    
129975,195432,"A simple guide to CRISPR, one of the biggest science stories of 2016",Vox,Brad Plumer,2016/12/30,2016.0,12.0,http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/30/13164064/crispr-cas9-gene-editing,  one of the big and most important science story of      will probably also be one of the big science story of the next decade   so this be as good a time as any to get acquaint with the powerful new    technology know as crispr       if have not hear of crispr yet   the short explanation go like this   in the past four year   scientist have figure out how to exploit a quirk in the immune system of bacteria to edit gene in other organism        plant gene   mouse gene   even human gene   with crispr   can now make these edit quickly and cheaply   in day rather than week or month     the technology be often know as    but will stick with crispr   pronounce   crisper       let that sink in   be talk about a powerful new tool to control what gene get express in plant   animal   and even human   the ability to delete undesirable trait and   potentially   add desirable trait with more precision than ever before           related     be get close to designer baby     time to think through the ethic involve     in      alone   researcher have show crispr can do some truly astounding thing   like create mushroom that do not brown easily or edit bone marrow cell in mouse to treat    anemia   down the road   crispr may help develop    crop   create powerful new antibiotic   or treat disease like cystic fibrosis   crispr may one day even allow to wipe out entire population of    mosquito or resurrect    specie like the passenger pigeon   and   while there be real limit to what crispr can do   researcher be work to overcome       much of the hype around crispr have focus on whether may engineer human with specific genetic trait   like heighten intelligence   particularly after chinese researcher show could edit human embryo this year   but in some way   that   a sideshow     designer baby   be still far off   and there be enormous obstacle to make those sort of complex genetic modification   the stuff that   close at hand        from new therapy to revolution in understanding of the genome        be what   most exciting   so here   a basic guide to what crispr be and what can do       what the heck be crispr   anyway     if want to understand crispr   should go back to        when japanese scientist study e  coli first come across some unusual repeat sequence in the bacteria  s dna     the biological significance of these sequence     write     be unknown     over time   other researcher find similar cluster in the dna of other bacteria   and archaea     give these sequence a name   cluster regularly interspace short palindromic repeats        or crispr   yet these crispr sequence be mostly a mystery until        when food scientist study the streptococcus bacteria use to make yogurt show how these odd cluster actually serve a vital function   be part of the bacteria  s immune system       see   bacteria be under constant assault from virus and produce enzyme to fight off viral infection   whenever the bacteria  s enzyme manage to kill off an invade virus   other little enzyme will come along   scoop up the remain of the virus  s genetic code   cut up into little bit   and then store in those crispr space   now come the clever part   the bacteria use the genetic information store in these crispr space to fend off future attack   when a new infection occur   the bacteria produce special attack enzyme        know as cas         that carry around those store bit of viral genetic code like a mugshot   when these cas  enzyme come across a virus   see if the virus  s rna match what   in the mugshot   if there   a match   the cas  enzyme start chop the virus  s dna up and neutralize the threat   look a little like this                 so that   what    do   but for a while   this discovery be not of much interest to anyone except microbiologist        until a series of further breakthrough occur       how do crispr revolutionize gene editing   in        jennifer doudna of the university of california berkeley and emmanuelle charpentier of ume  university in sweden be puzzle over how the    system actually work   how do the cas  enzyme match the rna in the mugshot with that in the virus   how do the enzyme know when to start chop     the scientist soon discover could   fool   the cas  protein by feed artificial rna        a fake mugshot   when do that   the enzyme would search for anything with that same code   not just virus   and start chop   in a landmark      paper   doudna   charpentier and martin jinek show could use this    system to cut up any genome at any place want     while the technique have only be demonstrate on molecule in test tube at that point   the implication be breathtake   further advance follow   feng zhang   a scientist at the broad institute in boston      a paper in science in february      show that    could be use to edit the genome of cultured mouse cell or human cell   in the same issue of science   harvard  s george church and team show how a different crispr technique could be use to edit human cell   since then   researcher have find that    be ridiculously versatile   not only can scientist use crispr to   silence   gene by snip out        can also harness repair enzyme to substitute in desire gene into the   hole   leave by the snipper   though this latter technique be tricky to pull off     so   for instance   scientist could tell the cas  enzyme to go snip out a gene that cause huntington  s disease and insert a   good   gene to replace               gene edit be not new   various technique to knock out gene have be around for year   what make crispr so revolutionary be that   incredibly precise   the cas  enzyme mostly go wherever tell to go   and   incredibly cheap and easy   in the past   may have cost thousand of dollar and week or month of fiddle to alter a gene   now may cost just      and only take a few hour   and this technique have work on every organism   be try on       this have become one of the hot field around   in        there be few than     publish paper on crispr   in        there be more than         and counting   with new refinement to crispr   new technique for manipulate gene   improvement in precision   and more     this have become such a    field that even have trouble keep up now     say doudna     be get to the point where the efficiency of gene editing be at level that be clearly go to be useful therapeutically as well as a vast number of other application     there   still an intense legal battle over who   exactly   should get credit for this crispr technology        be doudna  s      paper the breakthrough   or be zhang  s      paper the key advance   the lawsuit around these patent be currently underway   with the fate of licensing fee worth potentially billion of dollar at stake   but the important thing be that crispr have arrive   so what can use crispr for                so many thing   paul knoepfler   an associate professor at uc davis school of medicine   tell vox that crispr make feel like a   kid in a candy store       at the most basic level   crispr can make much easy for researcher to figure out what different gene in different organism actually do        by   for instance   knock out individual gene and see what trait be affect   this be important   while have have a complete   map   of the human genome since        do not really know what function all those gene serve   crispr can help speed up genome screening   and genetic research could advance massively as a result   but the real fun        and   potentially   the real risk        could come from edit gene of various plant and animal   a recent paper in nature biotechnology by rodolphe barrangou and doudna list a flurry of potential application in the future       edit crop to be more nutritious   crop scientist be already look to use crispr to edit the gene of various crop to make tasty   or more nutritious   or well survivor of heat and stress   could potentially use crispr to snip out the allergen in peanut   korean researcher be look to see if crispr could help banana survive a deadly fungal disease   some scientist have show that crispr can create hornless dairy cow        a huge advance for animal welfare        over the past year   major company like monsanto and dupont have begin license crispr technology   hope to develop valuable new crop variety   while this technique will not entirely replace traditional gmo technique        which can transplant gene from one organism to another        crispr be a versatile new tool that can help identify gene associate with desire crop trait much more quickly   could also allow scientist to insert desire trait into crop more precisely than traditional breeding   which be a much messy way of swapping in gene     with genome editing   can absolutely do thing could not do before     say pamela ronald   a plant geneticist at university of california davis   that say   caution that   only one of many tool for crop modification out there        and the challenge of successfully breed new variety could still take year of testing       also possible that these new tool could attract controversy   food that have have a few gene knock out via crispr be currently regulate more lightly than traditional gmo   policymaker in washington   dc   be currently debate whether may make sense to rethink regulation here   this piece for ensia by maywa montenegro delve into some of the debate crispr raise in agriculture       new tool to stop genetic disease   scientist may also use    to edit the human genome and knock out genetic disease like huntington  s disease or cystic fibrosis   scientist have even show that crispr can knock hiv infection out of t cell   so far   however   scientist have only test this on cell in the lab   there be still a few hurdle to overcome before anyone start clinical trial on actual human   for example   the cas  enzyme can occasionally   misfire   and edit dna in unexpected place   which   in human cell   may lead to cancer or even create new disease   over the past year   there have be major advance in improve crispr precision and reduce these    effect   but scientist be urge caution on human testing until standard can be develop here   there   also plenty of work yet to be do in actually deliver the editing molecule to particular cell        a major challenge go forward       powerful new antibiotic and antiviral   one of the most frightening public health fact around be that be run low on effective antibiotic as bacteria evolve resistance to   currently     difficult and costly to develop fresh antibiotic for deadly infection   but    system could   in theory   be develop to eradicate certain bacteria more precisely than ever   though   again   figure out delivery mechanism will be a challenge     other researcher be work on crispr system that target virus such as hiv and herpe            gene drive could alter entire specie   scientist have also demonstrate that crispr could be use   in theory   to modify not just a single organism but to modify an entire specie     an unnerve concept call   gene drive     work like this   normally   whenever an organism like a fruit fly mate   there   a    chance that will pass on any give gene to offspring   but use crispr   scientist can alter these odd so that there   a nearly     percent chance that a particular gene get pass on   use this gene drive   scientist could ensure that an alter gene soon propagate throughout an entire population in short order               by harness this technique   scientist could   say   genetically modify mosquito to only produce male offspring        and then use gene drive to push that trait through an entire population   over time   the population would go extinct   or could modify tick so that do not spread lyme   or eliminate weed   name   suffice to say   there be lot of concern about unintended side effect here   and the national academy of sciences have recommend a moratorium on deploy this technology until better understand impact       create   designer baby     this be the one that get all the attention     not entirely    to think may one day use crispr to edit the human genome        to eliminate disease   or select for athleticism   or for superior intelligence   that say   scientist be not even close to be able to do this   in april        for the first time ever   chinese researcher attempt

prime minister benjamin netanyahu  s government as   the most    in israeli history     be not just take a pot shot at a foreign leader the obama administration have come to loathe         the top us diplomat be instead make an accurate assessment of an important   and dangerous   shift in israel  s domestic politic   with the country  s left wing hobble by electoral loss and bitter infighting   netanyahu believe big political threat come from the right   not the left   that   lead to adopt precisely the sort of hawkish policy        like oversee a massive increase in the population of israel  s west bank settlement        that prompt kerry  s speech   and that have leave israel more isolated at the united nations than ever before     bibi be not concerned at all with anyone from the center leave     gilead sher   a former israeli peace negotiator and chief of staff for prime minister ehud barak   tell in an interview   use the prime minister  s nickname       concerned about    politician inside and outside own party that be totally against any division of the land or agreement with the palestinians   those be the only people that think could push out of office     the bitter      election have understandably keep many americans focus firmly on politic here at home   but israel be one of america  s close and most strategically important ally   and understanding why netanyahu feel compel to move continually more to the right be vital to understanding why even the election of the fervently    donald trump may not be enough to keep the jewish state from become further isolate on the world stage       the dramatic change in israel  s domestic politic have shape netanyahu  s handling of the moribund peace process with the palestinians   the primary focus of kerry  s blistering speech on wednesday   netanyahu have publicly commit to a    solution to the    conflict   in practice   though   have oversee a massive expansion of israel  s web of west bank settlement   which now house more than           israelis and occupy so much territory that would be almost impossible to cobble together a contiguous palestinian state       most israelis reject the obama administration  s belief that west bank settlement be an obstacle to peace and that   to netanyahu  s rival on israel  s right   be exactly the point   naftali bennett   the head of the    jewish home party   tell reporter last month that   the era of a palestinian state be over     bennett want israel to formally annex    percent of the west bank   a move that would deal a final death blow to the prospect of an independent palestine        put another way   israel  s domestic politic be lead netanyahu down a path certain to fuel effort to punish country both economically and in place like the international criminal court   understanding why mean understand how different israel  s political system be from america  s        and how completely left wing have collapse        israel  s    party dominate the election israel   the only democracy in the middle east   use a parliamentary system   that mean prime minister be not directly elect like the president be in the us   instead   can only take israel  s top post if assemble a coalition of at least    seat in israel  s knesset   or parliament   and that   where israel  s rightward drift be most apparent   head into election night in        israeli pollster think netanyahu and isaac herzog   the head of israel  s    zionist union party   would each win    seat in the country  s    parliament   theoretically give each a chance to become prime minister     the pollster be wrong   netanyahu  s likud party win    seat   while herzog  s take just      in all      or    party take    seat   while    or    one take just      the result make netanyahu the first prime minister in israeli history to win four term in office     israel have no term limit   prime minister serve for as long as maintain    majority         netanyahu  s rival reject an independent palestine and be spar solely over how much of the west bank to annex the election also continue the right wing  s historical political dominance   sher note that of the    israeli government in the past    year   just two be lead by    prime minister   the      government of yitzhak rabin   who be assassinate by a    ideologue   and the    one lead by sher  s former boss   ehud barak   after beat netanyahu in        even the    nobel peace    shimon peres   whose death this year prompt mourn from leader around the globe   run for prime minister five time but never win an election outright     there   a simple reason for that   the israeli public have move steadily to the right because of palestinian terrorism and the widespread belief that palestinian leader be not truly committed to resolve the    conflict     a pew research poll of israeli jews and arabs earlier this year find that just   percent of the respondent describe as member of the political left   fully    percent say identify with the right wing   the same poll find that just    percent of israeli jews believe that   a way can be find for israel and an independent palestinian state to coexist peacefully       other poll have find that narrow majority of israelis still support a    solution   but by small and small margin       most israelis also reject the obama administration  s belief that west bank settlement be an obstacle to peace   the main theme of kerry  s speech wednesday   accord to pew      percent of israeli jews say the settlement help israel  s security   while just    percent say harm     the remainder say do not make a substantive difference     netanyahu have many fault   but   a canny politician who know a political trend when see one   the israeli public be move ever more to the right   netanyahu be move right along with   to understand netanyahu   look at who serve in government and that bring back to the israeli prime minister  s bitter fight with the obama administration   as recently as november        netanyahu say still want to see   two state for two people   a demilitarize palestinian state that recognize a jewish state          the problem be that netanyahu  s own policy be make the creation of an independent palestine more remote than ever before   nearly           jews live in east jerusalem and the west bank   a figure that have grow by           just since obama take office in          the vast bulk of the settler live in a cluster of town and city just along israel  s border with the west bank and would almost certainly be annex into israel as part of any peace deal with the palestinians   but a substantial and grow number live so deep in the west bank that break the territory into canton separate by military checkpoint and road set aside for the exclusive use of the israelis       for many of netanyahu  s rabidly    political rival   the israeli prime minister  s policy do not go nearly far enough     take bennett   the    politician push for israel to formally annex    percent of the west bank   during coalition negotiation with netanyahu   bennett be name education minister   while a telegenic female member of bennett  s party   ayelet shaked   be name justice minister     like bennett   shaked oppose palestinian statehood   but   also take step on the domestic front that be draw international condemnation   the late flashpoint be a propose law require israeli ngos to publicly reveal how much of overseas donation come from foreign government or group like the european union   critic see as a thinly veil way of try to silence group critical of netanyahu and government   an even big controversy have erupt over a propose bill that would retroactively legalize west bank settlement build on land own by palestinians   the legislation be strongly support by bennett and hawkish member of netanyahu  s own party   the israeli prime minister oppose the legislation and have deride as   childish and irresponsible     but have not kill the bill because of fear about the political consequence of stand against israel  s ascendant right wing       daniel friedmann   a former israeli justice minister   tell the washington post that   netanyahu really want to avoid this             and   could stop if really want to   but be not in an easy position   because do not want the settler to think that be the one who throw out     the debate in israel have move from how much of the west bank to give up to how much of the west bank to annex in the meantime      politician inside and outside of netanyahu  s likud party be openly reject the idea of create an independent palestine and instead spar solely over how much of the west bank to annex     bennett want    percent   danny danon   israel  s ambassador to the un   want israel to annex every one of west bank settlement   netanyahu  s housing minister   uri ariel   want to eventually take all of the west bank   deputy foreign minister tzipi hotovely   a rise star sometimes see as a potential future prime minister   also want to annex all of the west bank   that   anathema to most of the international community   include the obama administration   and to    israelis like sher   who lead the    peace talk at camp david in the        in the interview   sher say israel should prepare for a future peace deal   no matter how remote seem   by lay the groundwork for withdraw from the west bank settlement that would eventually have to be evacuate to allow for the creation of a palestinian state     can not have all   and should not have all     say     zionism never aspire to govern another people for    year   instead of fight the world   should pave the way for protect the core value of the jewish state       that may not happen anytime soon   netanyahu  s rival on the israeli right be about to get a new and unexpected ally   david friedman   donald trump  s pick to be the next us

129980,195437,The UN’s resolution on Israel doesn’t include any sanctions. It could hurt Israel’s economy all the same.,Vox,Zeeshan Aleem,2016/12/29,2016.0,12.0,http://www.vox.com/world/2016/12/29/14099426/un-resolution-hurt-israeli-economy,  the    united nations resolution condemn israeli settlement that pass last week do not impose any kind of financial sanction or other punitive measure on israel   what do do   though   be essentially give the green light to activist group and country to accelerate campaign aim at strike israel  s economic interest and weaken international reputation   and that could potentially prove to be just as damaging       in the past few year   movement like   boycott   divestment   and sanction     bds   a campaign model off the economic activism that help end apartheid in south africa   have begin to gain traction in the west   and in november        the european union issue new guideline on the labeling of import good that distinguish between good from israel proper and those from settlement in occupy palestinian territory   a policy that   expect to hurt israeli export   last month   france become the first country to enforce the new guideline     so far   the impact of these effort have be modest   but if continue to gain momentum with boost like the un resolution   real money be at stake   expert estimate could lop anywhere from      billion to      billion off the israeli economy over the next decade     that   a substantial sum of money   but perhaps even more important be the psychological toll such economic pressure would exact on israel  s government   force to consider how already beleaguer international reputation could slide even further   that in turn could change the calculation the israeli government make about the price   willing to pay for defense of settlement       bds be a banner for a lot of different campaign bds be an umbrella campaign launch by palestinians and run by    activist around the world that aim to apply economic pressure on israel in order to push government to concede to three main demand   in own word   these be              end occupation and colonization of all arab land and dismantle the wall   international law recognize the west bank   include east jerusalem   gaza and the syrian golan heights as occupy by israel       grant    citizen of israel right to full equality     respect   protect and promote the right of palestinian refugee to return to home and property as stipulate in un resolution       to do this   the bds movement advocate for and organize boycott of israeli good and company   call for institution like bank and university to exclude israeli company from investment   and lobby for the imposition of international sanction           but although bds have a formal mission statement   in reality serve as a banner for a number of different group and individual with a wide variety of view and motive   bds have attract member who want to do more than just stop israel  s occupation of the west bank and policy toward gaza     as vox  s zack beauchamp have write     while the movement take no official position on how to end the    conflict   one of    omar barghouti   have call for unify into a single state   which would mean dissolve israel as a jewish state     that   feed concern among some israeli observer that the thrust of bds be ultimately at odd with a    solution     and although leader reject discrimination and racism against jews   beauchamp explain that   proponent of    which be rise globally   have also at time gravitate toward bds   this spring in south africa   for example   protester rally in support of bds shout     jews do not belong here in south africa           there be also variation when come to tactic   some campaign consider all israeli business fair game   while other argue for only target business in and product from israeli settlement     bds be on the upswing        and could continue to accelerate attempts by palestinian group to use boycotts   divestment   and sanction to pressure israel predate bds        go back at least as far as the        accord to yousef munayyer   executive director of the us campaign for palestinian rights   but munayyer say take on a particularly organize and sustain form know as bds after a large group of palestinian civil society institution range from ngos to labor union make a call in      for people around the world to band together for boycott against israel   bds have be around for more than a decade   and enjoy high level of support among palestinians   in part because seem to have well prospect of effect change than the divided and anemic palestinian political leadership   but   really in the past few year that   begin to gain international prominence   evolve from a fringe movement to an adversary of israel worthy of harsh criticism from the prime minister     the bds movement  s accomplishment mainly fit under the   b   and   d   category        have be successful in promote sustained boycott and divestment        but have not persuade state government   which do not want to interfere with the    peace process   to impose sanction on israel      in the past few year   score of university   pension fund   church   and union in the us   europe   and elsewhere have support bds by boycott israeli good and investment   the united methodist church  s      billion pension board   the big pension fund asset manager in the us   blacklist the five large israeli bank   norway  s       billion government pension fund global   the world  s large sovereign wealth fund   blacklist two israeli company over involvement in settlement building in east jerusalem     the student council of most of the university of california campus have vote in favor of request that the university system administrator div from american company make money from the settlement   the national women  s studies association and other academic group in the us have vote to boycott israeli university   legendary physicist stephen hawking refuse to attend a conference in israel in solidarity with bds        while bds  s actual economic impact on israeli business so far be small   campaign can frequently deal a significant blow to a brand  s reputation a handful of large and prominent western company have pull out of israel in recent year as well   although   difficult to ascertain exact motive for do so   for example   when the french telecom group orange end brand licensing deal with an israeli mobile operator in        some remark about the end of the deal by ceo be perceive as sympathetic to bds     while bds claim as a victory   the company say the campaign have no role in decision   and the ceo ultimately travel to israel to apologize and smooth thing over   that seem to fit a pattern   french infrastructure company veolia frame withdrawal from the israeli market as part of a debt reduction strategy   but bds claim that multiyear pressure campaign on the company be the real reason     when the israeli company sodastream shut down factory in the west bank in        the company  s ceo   daniel birnbaum   say that be for restructure purpose   and assert that the boycott movement that have target due to the factory  s location have a   marginal   effect on business     but accord to testimony birnbaum submit to congress   the bds movement have more than a minor role in sodasteam  s business outlook and cost the company sponsorship event abroad     there be absolutely no doubt that reputation as individual and as a company be compromise because of association with the lie and allegation direct at from the bds     birnbaum say     sodastream  s experience get to the heart of the matter here   while bds  s actual financial impact on foreign and israeli business in israel so far be extremely small   campaign can frequently deal a significant blow to a brand  s reputation over time   and that   enough to change the behavior of institution that want to maximize bottom line     so while bds campaign be not yet close to capable of bring israeli business to knee   in the aggregate could easily become a substantial factor in the calculation that investor worldwide make about israel  s business climate        the symbolic victory of un resolution be likely to invigorate bds activist and drive to to pursue big campaign and target more israeli company   if really pick up steam   that could come at a real cost to israel  s private sector   analyst estimate that a chill in foreign investment result from bds campaign could cost israel billion a year       the eu  s disapproval of settlement be a major point of concern for israel in addition to grassroot bds effort   the eu be the other major source of economic pressure on israel   although such activity be target specifically at settlement activity   not israel more broadly   in        the eu create guideline that say any israeli entity that want to receive funding or apply for grant from eu foundation or institution have to declare that have no link to the west bank   east jerusalem   or the golan heights   a strategically important plateau israel seize from syria in      and annex in        and last year establish guideline for member state to clearly label all good import from    palestinian territory as such   in an attempt to discourage israel  s settlement activity   many european nation also warn business of the legal and reputational risk of do business in the settlement     some of the guideline be not mandatory   and member state can choose to enforce differently   france be the first country to actually begin enforce the labeling guideline in november        a year after be establish   but   possible the strong language from the un resolution could empower advocate within the eu who want more member state to observe the guideline and put more pressure on israel over settlement activity        as with bds   the power of the eu  s disapproval of israel  s settlement lie more in the aura of israeli misbehavior than do in specific economic measure   even if europe cease to import all good come from the settlement   that would affect a mere   percent of the good that israel export to the eu   but increase scrutiny over the origin of israeli export could dampen overall demand in europe         the big cost of economic punishment be reputation israel have a strong economy   a large part of which be drive by a booming tech sector that house a number of premier western tech firm     difficult to see how even a massive surge in bds campaign could destroy that dynamic   and so far   bds  s success have not prevent israel from see a steep increase in foreign investment in recent year     but the country  s big concern be similar to that of israeli business be target by bds        the cost to reputation          not just an impact of dollar and cent   but   an impact that be psychological as well     munayyer say       about the effect of know that there be cost in the form of international isolation to continue down the road israel be on     israeli leader be deeply concerned that an uptick in successful bds campaign and increase enforcement of eu guideline would isolate in the global arena   that   why politician from across the political spectrum in israel have begin to describe bds as an existential threat in recent year   and argue that chief goal be   delegitimization       the fear for israel be not that boycotts and sanction will lead to economic ruin     that the movement could leave entirely friendless in the international community   and lead to the loss of leverage in negotiation over the question of palestine    
129981,195438,9 questions about the UN vote on Israeli settlements you were too embarrassed to ask,Vox,Jennifer

israeli settlement in palestinian territory have trigger a brutal and messy diplomatic fight between president obama   israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu   and now    donald trump       the war of word get even nasty wednesday   when secretary of state john kerry deliver a    speech warn that netanyahu  s settlement policy could doom any chance at a peace deal and threaten israel  s future as a jewish and democratic state       the status quo be lead toward one state and perpetual occupation     kerry warn     the israeli prime minister publicly support a    solution   but current coalition be the most    in israeli history   with an agenda drive by most extreme element       netanyahu immediately shoot back that kerry  s speech be   bias against israel   and   obsessively focus   on settlement   and   barely touch upon the root of the conflict        palestinian opposition to a jewish state in any boundary          so who   right   and why be both country so angry     a complex answer that involve geopolitical maneuvering   international legal issue   and a healthy dose of seemingly nonsensical diplomatic language   so would be forgive for feel a little bit lose try to sort out exactly what   go on       if so   do not worry   have get covered   what follow be a simple guide to the whole kerfuffle           what do the obama administration do at the un   the united states on friday abstain on a vote over a un security council resolution demand an end to israeli settlement in palestinian territory   by abstain        instead of veto the resolution   as the united states have reliably do to similar measure for decade        the obama administration allow the highly symbolic measure to make through the chamber by a unanimous    margin        be the first time in nearly    year that the security council have pass a resolution critical of israeli settlement   be also a firm rebuke of both netanyahu   who have strongly argue against the resolution   and trump   who have take the highly unprecedented move of weigh in on thursday   before the vote   and press for the measure to be veto   the jewish community in question be in the west bank and east jerusalem   both of which be capture by israel during       s    war   range in size from small outpost of just a few dozen people to ariel   home to some          people and a thriving university   two of the more controversial settlement lie inside and adjacent to hebron   a large palestinian city that house the burial place of abraham   make one of the holy site in both judaism and islam   dozen of jews and muslims have be kill in political violence there in recent decade   israel  s construction of new neighborhood throughout east jerusalem be technically as illegal as settlement building elsewhere in the west bank   but many american policymaker from both party have long acknowledge that jewish neighborhood in that part of the city would remain under israeli control in any peace agreement   that   particularly true of the jewish quarter of the old city   home to the western wall   the most religiously important place in judaism          important to note that the settlement population be enormous and rapidly grow     nearly           jews live in east jerusalem and the west bank   a figure that have grow by           just since obama take office in          cite those statistic   administration official say have to act now because the population be so big that would soon be basically impossible for israel to withdraw from any meaningfully large part of the west bank        help to doom the already faint chance of a peace deal       what do the resolution actually say   un resolution      be a long document full of diplomatic jargon   can read the full text here   so will just skip to the important part     the resolution demand that israel   immediately and completely cease all settlement activity in the occupied palestinian territory   include east jerusalem     and declare that the establishment of settlement by israel have   no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation under international law       this be far strong language than the united states have ever officially use to describe israeli settlement activity before   although the standard us position have for three decade be that such settlement   which be build on land intend to be part of a future palestinian state   be   obstacle to peace     the united states have always stop short of describe as   illegal   under international law   the resolution condemn   all measure aim at alter the demographic composition   character and status of the palestinian territory occupy since        include east jerusalem     list among those measure   the construction and expansion of settlement   transfer of israeli settler   confiscation of land   demolition of home and displacement of palestinian civilian   in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant resolution         the text also call on all member state   to distinguish   in relevant dealing   between the territory of the state of israel and the territory occupy since               language that   as the times of israel  s eric cortellessa explain     israel fear will lead to a surge in boycott and sanction effort       finally   the measure include a request that the un secretary general report to the security council every three month on the resolution  s implementation        all but guarantee that there will continue to be regular engagement on the issue         what practical effect   if any   do the resolution have     the resolution  s effect be primarily diplomatic and political   though there be some potential legal implication in the long term     to begin with     a    resolution   that mean   basically just a strongly word statement that do not impose any sort of sanction or other punishment on israel for past settlement activity   nor do put in place such measure to punish israel for any future settlement activity   those would have to be include in a separate security council resolution   and   virtually certain that both obama and trump would veto such a measure     the whole point of the resolution be to further solidify the longstanding international consensus that israel  s settlement activity be illegal and a roadblock to achieve a peaceful solution to the      conflict        in other word   to isolate israel and show that the whole world think what be do be wrong   the hope be that this will make israel change policy in order to get back into the good grace of the international community     but israel be free to completely ignore the resolution and tell the international community to stuff   and indeed   israel  s government initially look like would do just that   announce monday that plan to move ahead with the construction of nearly         new home in the predominantly palestinian eastern jerusalem   with     settlement due to be approve wednesday         remain unfazed by the un vote   or by any other entity that try to dictate what do in jerusalem       the city  s deputy mayor   meir turgeman   tell the newspaper israel hayom   however   on wednesday   netanyahu reportedly instruct the jerusalem municipality to wait on approve new housing unit in an attempt to avoid further inflame    relation   still   the resolution could potentially have some    legal and economic implication for israel   for instance   tel aviv university law professor aeyal gross write at haaretz that the resolution could encourage the international criminal court to be more aggressive in examination of settlement construction     icc prosecutor fatou bensouda be currently work on a report on the    conflict   but be not a    investigation   and no criminal case have be bring against israel   gross explain that this could potentially change due to the new un resolution       the consensus that the resolution represent on the illegality of the settlement and the description of construction as a   flagrant   violation of international law may convince bensouda that have strong ground to pursue the matter before the icc     write gross     and indeed   palestinian leader be already say that will use the resolution to seek international criminal court indictment of israeli leader   push for a formal probe into whether israel be violate the geneva conventions   and get foreign government to ban the import of any product make in israeli settlement       why be this resolution happen now     the push to bring this resolution before the security council in the last few remain day of obama  s term as president seem to have be a calculated move by palestinian diplomat        the wall street journal report     as early as october   palestinian diplomat at the un begin assess prospect for a security council resolution   draft two resolution   one that would condemn israel  s rapid expansion of settlement in dispute territory of west bank and east jerusalem   and another that would recognize palestine as a state at the un     arab diplomat tell the journal that the palestinians ultimately decide to drop the statehood resolution because believe would inevitably be veto by the obama administration     the palestinians appear to have see a path forward all the same   believe that obama  s    opposition to the israeli settlement        and deep animosity toward netanyahu        mean the us president may allow a slightly    resolution to make through the security council     james zogby   president of the arab american institute and an influential    activist   tell al jazeera     know that the obama administration be not go to restart the peace process   tell that the least could do be resurface the issue surround the illegality of settlement   something which have not be say since the carter administration     be decide that egypt   as the only arab member of the security council   should be the one to sponsor the resolution   and indeed   egypt be the measure  s initial sponsor   however   on thursday   just one day before the vote be schedule to take place   egypt suddenly announce that be delay the vote indefinitely     this be apparently in response to an unprecedented intervention by trump   in the form of a personal phone call to egyptian president abdel fattah    urge to table the vote   netanyahu   who have develop a close relationship with sisi   also press the egyptian leader to withdraw the measure       the resolution be then reintroduce on friday by four of the other    member of the security council        new zealand   malaysia   venezuela   and senegal        but not egypt   that resolution be the one that the us abstain on   and which ultimately pass          why do not the us veto the resolution     us ambassador to the un samantha power say in a statement after the vote that   be because this resolution reflect the fact on the ground        and be consistent with u  s  policy across republican and democratic administration throughout the history of the state of israel        that the united states do not veto     ben rhodes   obama  s deputy national security adviser for strategic communication   explain further to pbs newshour     have have fail peace process after fail peace process   and the pace of settlement construction have accelerate significantly   and just recently   have the israeli prime minister say that this be the most    in administration in israeli history   the israeli government that be currently in place   believe that at this pace   a    solution could be put at risk   believe that would be profoundly bad for israel and security   and so   that   why the president take the position that do     but beyond the white house  s formal statement on the matter   the move be widely see as obama  s parting shot at netanyahu   with whom the president repeatedly clash throughout tenure     as colleague zeeshan aleem write   although the obama administration give israel a big military aid package than any us president in history   and have veto past un condemnation of settlement   obama have a   tense and at time outright hostile relationship with the    netanyahu     among other thing   clash over israeli settlement expansion and the term of the controversial iran nuclear deal       but obama  s parting shot be also aim at trump   who have indicate want to take a much strong    stance   for instance   have say want to move the us embassy to jerusalem        a step that   as colleague zack beauchamp explain     every us government have refrain from do because the future of the dispute city be mean to be resolve as part of direct talk between the two side for a final status peace deal       and trump  s newly name ambassador to israel   david friedman        who have be a personal friend of trump  s for about    year        be staunchly    and have say oppose the    solution that have be a cornerstone of us policy about end the conflict for decade     possible that trump  s stunning intervention        directly meddle in a major us foreign policy decision before have even take office        may have play a role in ultimately push obama to take the dramatic step of abstaining on friday  s vote     but even if so     almost certainly not the main reason   as kerry state in speech defend the decision to abstain on the vote     do not take this decision lightly     the resolution be directly in line with obama  s own view on israeli settlement   and the vote be essentially obama  s way of make a symbolic last stand on an issue that have long concern but that prove wholly unable to do much of anything about during time in the white house          how do the israeli government react to the vote   not particularly well   in fact   be royally pissed     speak in a televise address at a hanukkah    ceremony on saturday   netanyahu angrily denounce the obama administration for have carry out what netanyahu term a   disgraceful    maneuver            the obama administration not only fail to protect israel against this    at the un   collude with behind the scene     netanyahu  s office say in a statement   the statement also say that israel   look forward   to work with the incoming trump administration to   negate   the resolution  s   harmful effect     then over the weekend   israeli official go even further   david keyes   a spokesperson for netanyahu   tell fox news on sunday that jerusalem have gather     information from source in both the arab world and internationally that this be a deliberate push by the united states and in fact help create the resolution in the first place       israeli ambassador ron dermer later tell cnn that would present this evidence of obama  s plot against israel to the incoming trump administration     if want to share with the american people   be welcome to do     dermer say   netanyahu immediately summon us ambassador daniel shapiro as well as ambassador from    of the    country that vote in favor of the resolution and have embassy in israel        britain   china   russia   france   egypt   japan   uruguay   spain   ukraine   and new zealand        to protest the resolution   the prime minister also instruct the foreign ministry to suspend any israeli diplomatic trip to country that support the resolution and reduce contact with embassy   the israeli government also lash out at the un   announce a series of retaliatory move aim at correct what see as unfair    bias within the institution and declare would halt    million shekel        about         million        in fund to five united nations institution that be   particularly hostile to israel     such as the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east   unrwa       finally   netanyahu warn nation against take any further action on this issue   declare that   israel be a country with national pride   and do not turn the other cheek         the israeli leader cap off attack at the obama administration with blister public response to kerry  s speech wednesday   what the secretary of state do   netanyahu charge     be spend most of speech blame israel for the lack of peace           why do israel care so much about this   there be strong international consensus on the illegality of israeli settlement   this be base on the fourth geneva convention   which ban nation from the moving of population into and the establishing of settlement in the territory of another nation win in war     israel  s    government   however   dispute that settlement in east jerusalem and the west bank be illegal   and maintain that final status should be determine in future negotiation on palestinian statehood   not by the united nations         the government  s rightward shift toward a more    stance in recent year be in part a result of the rapid growth of israel  s settler population     accord to datum from israel  s central bureau of statistics   the annual growth rate for the settler population   exclude east jerusalem   in      be more than two and a half time high than that of the overall population in israel         percent and       percent   respectively   kerry   in speech wednesday   note that the number of israeli settler in the west bank   not include east jerusalem   have increase by nearly           since the oslo peace accord   sign in      and        include           just since        when obama take office   as vox  s johnny harris note     over time   and especially as israeli politic have shift rightward   the settler movement have become an institutionalized part of israeli society         but there   another reason the israeli government care so much about what happen at the united nations in particular   netanyahu  s government believe that the united nations   and the international community more generally   be bias against israel   and that unfairly single out israel for censure while ignore egregious action by other country     this argument be not without merit   indeed   un secretary general ban    who be step down at the end of this year after have serve two    term   tell the security council earlier this month that     d ecade of political maneuvering have create a disproportionate number of resolution   report and committee against israel     and say that     i n many case   instead of help the palestinian issue   this reality have foil the ability of the un to fulfill role effectively     this late action by the un   then   be interpret by the israeli government as part of a broad campaign to delegitimize israel on the international stage   that the united states   israel  s close and most powerful ally   stand aside and let the resolution pass        and   accord to netanyahu   may have even be instrumental in bring the measure to the security council in the first place        make even more painful        could trump overturn the resolution when take office   trump have indicate that after take office on january        thing will be different   at the united nations      not anymore   the beginning of the end be the horrible iran deal   and now this   u  n      stay strong israel   january   th be fast approach        donald j  trump    realdonaldtrump   december               and once in office   trump could theoretically repeal the resolution by introduce a new resolution at the un that completely revoke this one   would then need to get at least eight other country to vote for   as well as ensure that none of the security council  s other permanent member        russia   the united kingdom   france   and china        veto   trump  s pick to be the next us ambassador to the un   nikki haley   would almost certainly support such a move   haley be perceive as be staunchly     as governor of south carolina   pass legislation

great move on delay   by v  putin       trump tweet     always know be very smart     but as with all such    pairing   the loom question be whether trump and putin will find fulfillment or

realize that if trump move too fast        especially in the wake of the hack scandal        would probably cause strong pushback from congress and elsewhere   instead   see putin  s most recent action as part of the    theater   prepare the ground for a    but still uncertain   future     putin will play this as obama act like a deranged and spiteful madman   while trump be a real gentleman

",    david priess   a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer at the cia   be the author of   the president s book of secrets   the untold story of intelligence briefings to america s president from kennedy to obama          ve learn that    donald trump have decline many intelligence briefing   delegate the daily task instead to vice    mike pence     get when need     trump say     m   like   a smart person   don t need to be tell the same thing and the same word every single day for the next eight year     in some way this be a departure from the approach of past president   but there s also widespread misunderstanding of the president s daily brief   pdb   and the tradition surround   here be five erroneous belief worth correct     myth no     the pdb have traditionally be for the president s eye only   the very title of this    intelligence report say so   s the president s book   and indeed   be tailor to each president s individual need   cia officer in      design what be initially know as the president s intelligence checklist specifically for john f  kennedy s taste   use punchy word and phrase while avoid clunky bureaucratic language and annoying classification marking   that checklist evolve into the president s daily brief in late        as the agency reformatte and retitle the book of secret to appeal to lyndon johnson s preference   while the name have stick   the content and format have continue to evolve   president obama receive in digital form and read on a tablet   but while through most of history the document have be mark   for the president s eyes only     the pdb have never go to the president alone   the most restricted dissemination be in the early        when the book go only to president richard nixon and henry kissinger   who be    as national security adviser and secretary of state   in other administration   the circle of reader have also include the vice president   the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff   along with additional white house staffer   by        obama s pdb be make way to more than    recipient   include the president s top strategic communication aide and speechwriter   and deputy secretary of national security department      myth no     senior intelligence officer have brief past president in person every day   the commander in chief have receive the pdb every working morning for the past    year      briefing   though   haven t be as frequent   president gerald ford   george h  w  bush   previously a cia director   and george w  bush want     briefing daily   but stand out as the exception   johnson and nixon rarely see cia director or senior intelligence officer for anything   much less to brief the pdb   president jimmy carter and ronald reagan discuss the daily book with national security adviser   not cia officer   president bill clinton and obama receive    presentation   but irregularly   take together   institutionalize daily briefing have occur during less than    year of the pdb s     former defense secretary bob gates   who have have insight into the use of the pdb by almost every president since johnson   tell that   one of the great value of the pdb be the interaction with the president   which allow the leadership of cia and the community to have a well idea of what s on the president s mind   where be come from on issue   what s on agenda and what need to know     but most often feedback have be in response to the write product and convey through the national security adviser      myth no     president get most of information on intelligence and national security from the pdb   vice president dick cheney   argue that pdbs should be keep out of the hand of    investigator   call   the family jewel     observer often speak as if the president wouldn t know anything about global development without   and put inordinate weight on what appear in the daily book around the time of a national security incident   for example   the house select committee on benghazi investigate obama s pdb in the day around september             to find out what and how be tell about the attack in that libyan city     the intelligence assessment in the pdb   however   be just one slice of a very large pie   important information make way to the president throughout the day   especially during crisis   from a variety of channel   meeting with top west wing adviser   message from the white house situation room   phone call from national security official and    intelligence briefing that extend beyond the material in the     pdb   during the cuban missile crisis   for example   kennedy be brief on cuba in frequent meeting at the white house   daily intelligence document keep up to speed on other world event but largely neglect cuba during those    day   similarly   johnson in early      start receive a daily vietnam report from the cia   obviate the need for the pdb to cover every detail on that topic as the war expand      myth no     president have place enormous weight on the pdb   as the ultimate product of the intelligence community s collection and analytic effort   the pdb tend to command respect   as some presidential comment reflect   speak with trevor noah on   the daily show   on december      obama imply that without the pdb   would be   fly blind     clinton tell that even on an uneventful day   get    percent of what need to make good decision across a range of issue from the daily document     can t imagine any president not take seriously   not read carefully     say   but several president have also point out the pdb s flaw and inconsistency   less than two month into term   president jimmy carter tell intelligence official that be   disappointed   with the analysis receive and want more   divergent view     and in november        as protest in iran against u  s  ally shah mohammad reza pahlavi spiral out of control   carter send a blistering note to national security team lament the   quality of political intelligence     the pdb also exasperate clinton       all the time     tell     because want more than could provide   even tell the    commission in april      that find the secretary s morning summary from the state department s bureau of intelligence and research more helpful than the pdb in provide context for development overseas   of all the president in the past    year   nixon place the least emphasis on the book     the pdb be not a central document in thinking     kissinger tell     be one input     nixon s distrust of the cia prompt to undervalue most of the agency s judgment   if read at all   in a meeting of the national security council in june        accuse analyst of try to use intelligence to support conclusion   rather than to make conclusion   didn t offer any direct feedback on a single pdb item during more than          year in office     myth no     the pdb isn t worth the president s time   the pdb contain timely and   hopefully   accurate assessment of national security threat and foreign policy opportunity   each article   draft by cia analyst     and   since     reform kick in more fully in        by colleague across the intelligence community     synthesize classified and unclassified source material into an assessment that be usually no long than a single page   focus on what the president need to know rather than what want to hear   but do the pdb really repeat thing   every single day   for the busy man in the world     a newcomer to analysis could be forgive for underestimate the value of successive article about the same country   region or city that share similar probabilistic and estimative language   but the slight distinction from one report to the next often provide the good decision advantage for the president   whether s smart or not   as obama explain in an interview last january   when go through the pdb     m look at   be there significant difference     the pdb s insight into what other government   group and individual around the globe be do or consider do     even if only marginally different than in the day or week before     help the commander in chief get ahead of crisis before develop or react to more confidently if do erupt   even when the text seem repetitive   there s value in such incremental update   clinton   for example   tell there be few day when feel get nothing out of the pdb     twitter    davidpriess    read more     washington s most exclusive meeting may lose luster under trump    think u  s  intel be in decline   these declassified memo may change mind      the bogus claim that obama   skip   intelligence briefing   follow the post s outlook section on facebook and twitter

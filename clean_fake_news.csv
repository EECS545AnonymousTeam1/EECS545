Cameron Sterling, the    son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests.  Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun.  The press conference on Wednesday is Cameron’s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his father’s death. “I came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,” said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. “People, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. “No more arguments, violence, crimes,” said Cameron. “Yes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace  —   no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. ” Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didn’t believe all police were “bad” and that all police “shouldn’t be punished for other police’s crimes”. “The police in Dallas, Texas, they didn’t deserve that,” said Cameron. Alton Sterling’s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there.  His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.

103460,151909,Shakespeare’s first four folios sell at auction for almost £2.5m,Guardian,,2016-05-25,2016.0,5.0,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/25/shakespeares-first-four-folios-sell-at-auction-for-almost-25m,"Copies of William Shakespeare’s first four books, dubbed the “Holy Grail of publishing” have sold for almost £2. 5m at auction. Christie’s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The £2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bard’s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched £1. 87m, well above its   estimate of between £800, 000 and £1. 2m. Christie’s book expert Margaret Ford said it was “exhilarating” to bring the newly recorded book to the public’s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwright’s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: “We are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeare’s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. “Even four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. ”"
103461,151910,My grandmother’s death saved me from a life of debt,Guardian,Robert Pendry,2016-10-31,2016.0,10.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/grandmothers-death-saved-me-life-of-debt,"Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmother’s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life.  My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimer’s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show  —   Jeopardy!  —   even if she wasn’t exactly sure who I was.  I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to.  I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other   jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldn’t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a   education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying Alzheimer’s disease.  I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes.  It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter  —   my mother  —   toward the end.  The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasn’t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmother’s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt.  This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmother’s “contribution”. I now work three jobs  —   one   and two    —   in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working   in a laboratory at a     dollar biomedical research institution.  The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons. Which is all a bit ironic considering that Alzheimer’s disease is, indirectly, the only reason I’m not utterly drowning right now."
103462,151911,I feared my life lacked meaning. Cancer pushed me to find some,Guardian,Bradford Frost,2016-11-26,2016.0,11.0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/26/cancer-diagnosis-existential-life-accomplishments-meaning,"It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my   grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: “I’m not the man I want to be. ” As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. I’d published a book. I’d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being “good enough” to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. I’d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, “I’ve finally broken through. ”  “I’m so proud of you,” my wife replied. “I’m so grateful you found a path that works. Let’s stick with it. ” That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about “living the right way” interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the “representative version” of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time.  I’ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I don’t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they won’t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, I’ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that I’ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, I’m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, what’s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next   months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the  % who achieve a “complete response” or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, we’re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till I’m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, I’ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. I’m not afraid."
103463,151912,"Texas man serving life sentence innocent of double murder, judge says",Guardian,,2016-08-20,2016.0,8.0,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-life-sentence-innocence-dna-richard-bryan-kussmaul,"A central Texas man serving a life sentence for a double murder in 1992 is innocent, as are three codefendants no longer in prison, a state judge has found. Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received   sentences and have already been released.  DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four weren’t involved in the fatal shootings of    Leslie Murphy and    Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a   opinion.  Allen’s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The state’s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the men’s claims they were innocent.  “The evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,” Kussmaul’s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco  . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three   James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years.  At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at Kussmaul’s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing.  “I was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,” Long said at the July hearing. “I had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. ”  If the court upholds the judge’s opinion and the men’s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.
